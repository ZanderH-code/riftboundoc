As a Reaction, another player gives two of those Recruits +1 [M], so the Recruits&#x27; Mights are 1, 1, 2, and 2. Then Fox-Fire resolves. The Recruits no longer have total Might 4 or less, so Fox-Fire&#x27;s controller must choose a legal subset of the original targets to affect.

<div class="rule-row rule-plain level-3"><div class="rule-id">356.3.e.3.</div><div class="rule-text">If a target ceases to meet the targeting requirements while the spell is on the chain, then meets them again, it&#x27;s a legal target. Example: A spell targets &quot;a unit at a battlefield.&quot; A player reacts with a spell that moves the unit to base, then another player reacts with a spell that moves it back to that battlefield, then the original spell resolves. The unit is a legal target.</div></div>

<div class="rule-row rule-plain level-3"><div class="rule-id">356.3.e.4.</div><div class="rule-text">If a target changes Zones to or from a Non-Board Zone and then returns to its original zone, it is no longer a legal target, because it&#x27;s not treated as the same object. Examples: An enemy unit at a battlefield is no longer a legal target if it is no longer an enemy, no longer a unit, or no longer at a battlefield. A unit with 3 or less Might is no longer a legal target if it is no longer a unit or if its Might is greater than 3. Something that&#x27;s exhausted is no longer a legal target if it is no longer exhausted. (It can&#x27;t stop being &quot;something.&quot;) A spell that&#x27;s played from hidden can normally only target its own battlefield or something at that battlefield. A target for such a spell may cease to be a legal target if it moves from the battlefield where that spell was played, even if the spell has no location targeting requirement otherwise.</div></div>

<div class="rule-row rule-plain level-3"><div class="rule-id">356.3.e.9.</div><div class="rule-text">The process for a card&#x27;s choice becoming Invalid or Unavailable is referred to as mistargeting. Example: A spell has the instruction &quot;Deal 2 to a unit at a battlefield.&quot; Before that instruction can execute, the chosen unit is moved to its base. The instruction will not be executed, because it specifies that the unit it chooses must be at a Battlefield, and by the time it attempted to execute, the unit was no longer valid as a choice.</div></div>

<div class="rule-row rule-plain level-3"><div class="rule-id">356.3.e.10.</div><div class="rule-text">It is possible for none of a spell&#x27;s instructions to be executed as it resolves, due to all of them requiring targets to act on and all of those targets becoming Invalid or Unavailable . In this case, the spell has no effect but is still considered played. Example: A player plays a spell that reads &quot;Deal 2 to a unit at a battlefield&quot; with no other instructions, and chooses an enemy unit at a battlefield. They also control a unit with the ability &quot;When you play a spell, give me +1 [M] this turn.&quot; Before the spell resolves, the chosen unit is moved to its base. The spell resolves and its only instruction cannot be executed, but the unit&#x27;s ability still triggers as the spell resolves and gives it +1 [M].</div></div>

<div class="rule-row rule-plain level-3"><div class="rule-id">356.3.e.11.</div><div class="rule-text">Instructions that can be partially followed are followed as much as possible and ignored otherwise. Example: A player plays a spell that says &quot;Discard 2, then draw 2&quot; If their hand is empty, the instruction to discard 2 will be ignored. They&#x27;ll still draw 2.

Look at the top 5 cards of your Main Deck. You may banish a unit from among them that has Might up to 1 more than the killed unit and play it, ignoring its cost. Then recycle the rest.&quot; While Baited Hook&#x27;s ability is on the chain, an opponent reacts with a spell that returns the friendly unit to its owner&#x27;s hand. Because the friendly unit is no longer a legal target, it can&#x27;t be killed and its Might is treated as null.

Example: Immortal Phoenix says &quot;When you kill a unit with a spell, you may pay [1][C] to play me from your trash.&quot; This ability triggers if Immortal Phoenix is in your trash immediately after you kill a unit with a spell, even if the unit you killed with a spell was that Immortal Phoenix.</div></div>

Example: A unit with 3 base Might and Shield 2 is in combat as a Defender. Since Shield applies, its current Might is 5. A player chooses it as the target for Last Stand, a spell that reads in part &quot;Double a friendly unit&#x27;s Might this turn.&quot; Its current Might is 5, so it gets +5 Might this turn, for a current Might of 10. After combat, Shield no longer applies, but the +5 Might from Last Stand does, so the unit&#x27;s Might is 8.</div></div>

The assigning player chooses which ability or effect applies, and then resolves the assignment. If this creates a situation where now more than one unit must be assigned with the same priority, those units may be assigned damage in any order as normal within that priority. Example: Two copies of Caitlyn, Patrolling (&quot;I must be assigned combat damage last.&quot;) have been given the Tank ability (&quot;I must be assigned combat damage first.&quot;). A player assigning damage to these two Caitlyns and one unit with no abilities could choose to fulfill both Caitlyns&#x27; Tank requirements by assigning them both damage before the other unit.</div></div>

<div class="rule-row rule-plain level-0"><div class="rule-id">451.</div><div class="rule-text">Layers are the mechanism in which Game Effects alter the Traits, Intrinsic Abilities, or other properties of Game Objects.</div></div>

<div class="rule-row rule-plain level-0"><div class="rule-id">452.</div><div class="rule-text">Layers are an organizational structure.</div></div>

<div class="rule-row rule-plain level-1"><div class="rule-id">452.1.</div><div class="rule-text">Layers only serve to structure the application and order that Game Effects apply to Game Objects to maintain consistency.</div></div>

<div class="rule-row rule-plain level-0"><div class="rule-id">453.</div><div class="rule-text">The layers are applied repeatedly until all effects operating on objects have been applied once and no changes have been processed.</div></div>

<div class="rule-row rule-plain level-1"><div class="rule-id">453.1.</div><div class="rule-text">Layers are applied in sequence. Each effect in them is applied as soon as able, and only a single time across all sequences.</div></div>

<div class="rule-row rule-plain level-1"><div class="rule-id">453.3.</div><div class="rule-text">The removal or disqualification of an effect is separate from the application of the effect, but still can only be applied once. Example: Fiora, Victorious has printed Might 4 and says &quot;While I&#x27;m Mighty, I have Deflect, Ganking, and Shield.&quot; If a player places a buff on Fiora, her Might is increased in the Arithmetic layer, after the layer for Ability-Altering Effects. The Ability-Altering Effect layer is then re-checked and the abilities Deflect, Ganking, and Shield applied. Since each effect has been applied once and there are no other effects to apply, Fiora&#x27;s characteristics are finalized as 5 Might with Deflect, Ganking, and Shield. While a buffed Fiora, Victorious is in combat as a defender, an additional +1 Might will be applied in the Arithmetic layer, giving her 6 Might and the 3 keywords. Example: A buffed Fiora, Victorious is in combat as a defender when her buff is removed. Reevaluating the layers in sequence, she no longer gains Deflect, Ganking, and Shield during the Ability-Altering Effect layer, so when the Arithmetic layer is evaluated, neither the buff (which is gone) nor Shield (which she no longer has) apply. She goes directly from 6 Might with three keywords to 4 Might with no keywords..</div></div>
