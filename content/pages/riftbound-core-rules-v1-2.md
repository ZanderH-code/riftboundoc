Riftbound  Core  Rules  
Last  Updated:  2025-12-01  
 
 
000.  Golden  and  Silver  Rules  
001.  Golden  Rule  
002.  Card  text  supersedes  rules  text.  Whenever  a  card  fundamentally  contradicts  the  rules,  the  card's  indication  is  what  is  true.  
050.  Silver  Rule  
051.  Card  text  uses  different  terminology  than  rules.  Card  text  should  be  interpreted  according  to  these  rules,  not  as  though  it  were  text  within  these  rules.  
052.  Card ,  when  written  in  card  effects,  is  shorthand  for  " Main  Deck  card."  Runes,  legends,  and  battleﬁelds  are  not  considered  cards  when  executing  the  abilities  and  effects  of  game  objects.  They  are  considered  cards  for  the  purposes  of  these  rules.  
053.  Cards  refer  to  themselves  in  the  ﬁrst  person.  
053.1.  *  Units  and  legends  say  "I,"  "me,"  etc.  
053.2.  *  Gear  and  spells  say  "this."  
053.3.  *  Battleﬁelds  say  "here."  
054.  “Can’t  beats  Can”  
054.1.  Cards  that  forbid  actions  or  effects,  as  a  broad  method  of  determination,  supersede  cards  that  allow  or  permit  that  same  action  or  effect.  
055.  When  executing  card  text,  do  as  much  as  you  can,  ignoring  impossible  instructions.  
055.1.  If  all  of  a  card’s  instructions  are  impossible,  it  is  still  played  and  resolved,  but  nothing  happens.  
100.  Game  Concepts  
101.  Deck  Construction  
102.  Riftbound  is  a  Trading  Card  Game  where  a  player  must  provide  their  own  cards  to  play  against  other  players.  
103.  To  play  Riftbound ,  a  player  must  have  two  Decks,  a  Champion  Legend ,  and  a  number  of  Battleﬁelds  determined  by  the  Mode  of  Play.  
103.1.  1  Champion  Legend  
103.1.a.  This  is  placed  in  the  Legend  Zone  at  the  start  of  the  game.  
103.1.b.  This  will  dictate  the  Domain  Identity  of  the  Main  Deck.  
103.1.b.1.  Cards  included  in  your  Deck  must  abide  by  your  Domain  Identity.  
103.1.b.2.  Your  deck’s  Domain  Identity  is  dictated  by  the  domains  of  your  Champion  Legend.  In  the  default  card  frame,  these  domains  appear  as  symbols  in  the  legend’s  upper

## Page 2

left  corner.  
103.1.b.3.  If  a  card  has  a  single  Domain ,  then  that  card  is  permitted  in  the  Domain  Identity  that  corresponds  to  the  same  Domain.  
103.1.b.4.  If  a  card  has  more  than  one  Domain ,  then  that  card  is  permitted  only  in  a  Domain  Identity  that  contains  all  of  the  indicated  Domains  on  that  card.  
103.2.  A  Main  Deck  of  at  least  40  cards  1  Chosen  Champion  Unit  Units  Gear  Spells  
103.2.a.  Chosen  Champion  
103.2.a.1.  This  will  be  placed  in  the  Champion  Zone  at  the  start  of  the  game.  
103.2.a.2.  Must  be  a  champion  unit  with  a  champion  tag  that  matches  the  tag  on  your  Champion  Legend.  Example:  Loose  Cannon  has  the  tag  Jinx .  Therefore,  a  player  could  choose  Jinx,  Rebel  or  Jinx,  Demolitionist  as  their  Chosen  Champion ,  because  they  also  have  the  tag  Jinx .  Example:  Tibbers  has  the  tag  Annie ,  but  it  is  a  signature  unit,  not  a  champion  unit.  It  cannot  be  your  Chosen  Champion ,  even  if  your  Champion  Legend  has  the  tag  Annie .  
103.2.a.3.  A  player’s  Chosen  Champion  is  both  the  speciﬁc  card  chosen  for  this  slot  during  Deck  Building  and  also  any  Champion  Unit  with  the  same  name  as  the  speciﬁc  card  selected  for  this  speciﬁc  slot  during  the  course  of  play.   Example:  A  player  chose  Jinx,  Rebel  as  their  Chosen  Champion.  One  copy  of  Jinx,  Rebel  starts  the  game  in  their  Chosen  Champion  zone.  Any  additional  copies  of  Jinx,  Rebel  in  their  Main  Deck,  their  hand,  their  trash,  or  on  the  board  also  count  as  their  Chosen  Champion  for  any  game  rules  and  effects  that  care  about  Chosen  Champion  status  during  the  game.  
103.2.b.  Your  Main  Deck  can  include  up  to  3  copies  of  the  same  named  card.  
103.2.b.1.  This  includes  your  Chosen  Champion.  Example:  A  deck  could  include  Volibear,  Furious  as  its  Chosen  Champion  and  still  include  2  more  copies  of  Volibear,  Furious.  
103.2.b.2.  Cards  have  different  names  even  if  they  represent  the  same  character.  Example:  A  deck  could  include  3  copies  of  Yasuo,  Remorseful  and  3  copies  of  Yasuo,  Windrider,  because  they  have  different  names.  
103.2.c.  Subject  to  Domain  Identity.  
103.2.d.  Your  deck  may  only  contain  3  total  Signature  cards  that  have  the  same  Champion  tag  as  your  Champion  Legend.  
103.2.d.1.  Regardless  of  name,  a  deck  may  only  contain  a  sum  total  of  3  Signature  cards.  
103.2.d.2.  All  of  the  Signature  cards  must  have  the  Champion  tag  that  corresponds  to  the  Champion  Legend  of  the  deck.  
103.2.d.3.  Signature  cards  are  not  Champion  units  and  cannot  be  placed  in  the  Champion  Zone .  
103.2.e.  During  Gameplay,  the  Main  Deck  is  Secret  Information.  
103.2.e.1.  It  cannot  be  looked  through  or  revealed  unless  instructed  by  a  card  effect.  
103.3.  Rune  Deck

Example:  Cards  in  a  player's  hand  are  owned  by  that  player.  Only  that  player  may  read  or  look  at  their  faces.    Example:  If  a  player  controls  a  facedown  card  at  a  battleﬁeld,  that  player  and  only  that  player  may  read  or  look  at  that  card's  face,  regardless  of  who  owns  that  card.

128.3.  The  back  side  of  a  card  is  presented  to  conceal  information  for  Private  and  Secret  information  cards.  For  example,  cards  in  the  Main  Deck  and  cards  in  hand  have  their  back  side  presented.  
128.4.  The  term  facedown  is  used  to  describe  the  state  during  regular  play  of  having  a  card's  back  side  presented  on  the  Board.  A  facedown  card’s  front  side  is  considered  Private  Information.

129.2.  This  is  also  referred  to  as  a  front  face.  
129.3.  This  can  be  identiﬁed  in  situations  where  the  back  is  not  easily  discernible  by  the  presence  of  the  Play  Cost  in  the  upper  left  corner  of  the  card.  
129.4.  Cards,  when  played,  are  played  with  their  front  face  presented.

130.3.b.  This  section  may  not  be  present  on  every  card.  
130.4  Effects  that  need  to  determine  a  card’s  cost  for  any  purpose  always  use  its  base  cost,  even  if  that  cost  is  altered  or  ignored  as  the  card  is  played.   Example:  Sky  Splitter  is  a  spell  that  costs  8  Energy  and  says  in  part  “This  spell's  Energy  cost  is  reduced  by  the  highest  Might  among  units  you  control.”  Lux,  Illuminated  is  a  unit  that  says  “When  you  play  a  spell  that  costs  5  or  more,  give  me  +3  [M]  this  turn.”  If  a  player  who  controls  Lux  plays  Sky  Splitter,  Lux’s  ability  will  trigger,  regardless  of  how  much  was  actually  paid  for  Sky  Splitter.  
131.  Name  
131.1.  Each  card  has  a  name  that  identiﬁes  it  uniquely.  
131.2.  This  is  usually  located  in  the  middle  of  the  card.  
131.3.  Cards  that  are  printed  in  different  languages  but  represent  the  same  card  are  considered  to  have  the  same  name  for  the  purposes  of  deckbuilding  and  gameplay.   Example:  Chemtech  Enforcer  in  English  and  its  counterpart  in  Chinese  are  considered  the  same  card,  despite  the  Name  element  on  the  card  reading  differently.  
131.4  Some  cards  have  both  a  short  name  and  a  subtitle.  For  all  purposes,  including  rules  and  deckbuilding,  such  a  card’s  name  is  “[Short  Name],  [Subtitle]”.  Example:  Kai’Sa,  Evolutionary  and  Kai’Sa,  Survivor  both  have  the  short  name  Kai’Sa,  but  they  have  different  names.  You  can  include  3  of  each  in  your  deck  under  normal  deckbuilding  rules.  If  one  of  them  is  your  Chosen  Champion,  the  other  is  not.  
132.  Category  
132.1.  A  card  can  have  one  or  more  Categories  and  Sub-Categories  based  on  the  properties  of  its  front  and  back  sides.  
132.2.  These  Categories  and  Sub-Categories  dictate  the  behaviors  of  the  card  during  play.  
132.3.  Spells  and  other  effects  can  refer  to  categories,  sub-categories,  supertypes,  card  types,  tags,  and  other  characteristics  inclusively  or  exclusively.   Example:  A  "non-unit  card"  is  any  card  that  is  not  a  unit.    Example:  A  "unit"  is  any  game  object  that  is  a  unit,  regardless  of  any  other  categories  it  belongs  to.  
132.4.  Main  Deck  Cards  begin  the  game  in  the  Main  Deck  or  (in  the  case  of  a  Chosen  Champion )  the  Champion  Zone.

148.2.a.1.  This  behaves,  once  activated,  like  a  spell  without  an  associated  card.  
149.  Spells  
150.  Spell  is  a  card  type.  
151.  A  spell  can  be  played  during  an  Open  State  Outside  of  Showdowns  on  its  controller's  turn.  
152.  A  spell  is  controlled  by  the  player  who  played  it.  
153.  A  spell  creates  a  game  effect  according  to  its  instructions  and  is  then  placed  in  the  Trash  of  the  player  who  owns  it.  
154.  When  a  spell  is  successfully  played,  a  player  executes  the  rules  text  of  the  spell.  This  is  called  Resolving  the  spell.  
154.1.  Spells  have  their  rules  text  executed  from  top  to  bottom  when  they  are  Resolved.  
154.2.  If  a  later  part  of  a  spell  applies  a  Replacement  Effect  that  alters  earlier  parts  of  the  spell,  apply  those  replacement  effects  as  appropriate.  Example:  A  spell  says  "Choose  a  unit.  Kill  it  the  next  time  it  takes  damage  this  turn."  and  "[Legion]  —  Kill  it  now  instead.  (Get  the  effect  if  you've  played  another  card  this  turn.) "  If  the  Legion  condition  is  satisﬁed,  the  unit  is  killed  immediately  and  the  instruction  to  kill  it  the  next  time  it  takes  damage  is  ignored,  even  if  the  unit  remains  on  the  board  somehow.  
154.3.  While  a  spell  or  ability  on  the  chain  is  Resolving ,  no  other  spells  or  abilities  can  be  ﬁnalized  on  the  chain  or  resolved,  including  triggered  abilities  or  game  effects  that  would  occur  as  a  result  of  the  execution  of  the  spell.  
154.3.a.  Finish  resolving  all  effects  of  a  spell  before  addressing  anything  the  spell  may  have  triggered  or  caused  through  execution.  
155.  Certain  Keywords  on  spells  are  not  executable  rules  text,  but  instead  intrinsic  properties  of  the  spell.  
155.1.  These  determine  inherent  properties  and  behaviors  of  the  spell  before  being  played  or  while  on  the  chain.

184.  Battleﬁelds  
184.1.  Control  is  established  over  Battleﬁelds  through  the  course  of  play.

184.3.  Control  can  be  Contested  through  the  course  of  play.  
184.3.a.  Contested  is  a  temporary  status  applied  to  the  battleﬁeld  when  a  Unit  controlled  by  a  Player  who  does  not  currently  Control  that  Battleﬁeld  Moves  or  otherwise  becomes  present  there.  
184.3.a.1.  Units  moving  to  or  being  played  to  a  battleﬁeld  apply  Contested  status  if  that  battleﬁeld  is  not  already  contested  and  that  Unit ’s  controller  does  not  already

## Page 20

control  that  battleﬁeld.  
184.3.b.  A  Battleﬁeld  remains  Contested  until  Control  is  established  or  re-established.  
184.3.c.  While  a  Battleﬁeld  remains  Contested,  Control  of  a  Battleﬁeld  cannot  change.  
184.3.d.  The  state  of  a  Battleﬁeld  being  Contested  is  used  to  determine  when  Combat  should  occur,  when  a  Showdown  without  a  Combat  should  occur,  and  when  Control  will  change.  
184.3.e.  At  this  time  Game  Effects  cannot  reference  this  status.  
184.4.  Control  is  established  by  having  Units  at  a  Battleﬁeld  at  the  end  of  a  Showdown  or  Combat  after  applying  the  contested  status.  
184.4.a.  If  a  player  controls  Units  at  a  Battleﬁeld,  outside  of  Combat ,  they  maintain  Control  of  that  Battleﬁeld  for  as  long  as  they  have  Units  at  that  Battleﬁeld.  
184.4.b.  A  player  maintains  control  of  a  Battleﬁeld  while  it  is  being  Contested  by  an  opponent.  
184.4.c.  If  a  player  has  no  Units  at  a  Battleﬁeld,  they  lose  Control  of  that  Battleﬁeld  immediately,  unless  it  is  Contested.  
184.5.  Control  is  a  constant  state.  
184.6.  Control  of  a  Battleﬁeld  determines  Control  of  its  Abilities.  
184.6.a.  While  a  Battleﬁeld  is  Controlled ,  its  Controller  controls  its  Abilities .  That  player  takes  responsibility  for  adding  them  to  the  Chain  if  applicable,  and  makes  all  choices  required  by  them  unless  otherwise  speciﬁed.  
184.6.b.  While  a  Battleﬁeld  is  Uncontrolled ,  its  Abilities  are  also  Uncontrolled.  The  Turn  Player  takes  responsibility  for  adding  them  to  the  Chain  if  applicable,  makes  all  choices  required  by  them  unless  otherwise  speciﬁed,  and  is  treated  as  their  Controller  if  any  game  rule  or  effect  requires  one.  Example:  The  Arena’s  Greatest  is  a  battleﬁeld  that  reads  “At  the  start  of  each  player's  ﬁrst  Beginning  Phase,  that  player  gains  1  point.”  This  ability  will  usually  trigger  while  the  battleﬁeld  has  no  controller.  If  it  does,  the  Turn  Player  goes  through  the  steps  of  adding  the  ability  to  the  chain  and  receives  priority  after  doing  so,  exactly  as  if  they  controlled  the  ability.  
184.6.c.  “You”  in  a  battleﬁeld’s  abilities  refers  to  the  battleﬁeld’s  Controller ,  as  does  the  implied  “you”  in  instructions  like  “draw  1.”  If  the  battleﬁeld  has  no  Controller ,  “you”  refers  to  no  one,  and  all  such  instructions  are  ignored.  
185.  Everything  Else  
185.1.  When  a  player  Plays  a  Card  or  other  Game  Object ,  they  are  established  as  that  Game  Object's  Controller.  
185.2.  For  Spells ,  they  are  the  Spell's  Controller.  
185.2.a.  That  player  chooses  targets.  
185.2.b.  That  player  chooses  modes.  
185.2.c.  That  player  pays  costs.

## Page 21

185.3.  For  Permanents  and  Runes ,  when  they  Enter  the  Board ,  that  player  is  assigned  as  that  Game  Object's  Controller.  
185.3.a.  That  player  may  make  decisions  about  the  Game  Object's  Inherent  Abilities.  
185.3.b.  That  player  may  make  decisions  about  the  Game  Object's  Unique  Abilities.  
185.3.c.  That  player  may  make  decisions  about  any  game  effects  or  decisions  necessary  while  the  card  is  being  played.  
185.3.d.  That  player  may  make  decisions  about  any  game  effects  created  from  "When  you  play  me"  effects  of  Permanents.  
185.4.  For  Abilities ,  they  are  the  Ability’s  Controller.  
185.4.a.  By  default,  the  Controller  of  an  Ability’s  Source  is  the  Controller  of  that  Ability.  
185.4.b.  Changes  to  Control  of  an  Ability’s  Source  do  not  change  Control  of  that  Ability.  
185.4.c.  That  player  chooses  targets.  
185.4.d.  That  player  chooses  modes.  
185.4.e.  That  player  pays  costs.  
186.  When  a  game  effect  or  rules  text  refers  to  the  Controller  of  a  speciﬁc  object,  it  can  be  referring  to  either  context  interchangeably.  
186.1.  The  method  of  assignment  of  control  is  different,  but  the  status  of  Control  is  the  same  across  all  Game  Objects.  
300.  Playing  the  Game  
301.  The  Turn  
302.  Play  continues  cyclically  until  one  player  wins.

303.2.  Game  Actions  cannot  be  performed  simultaneously  for  any  reason.  
303.2.a.  If  one  or  more  actions,  game  effects,  or  Triggered  Abilities  are  activated  simultaneously,  then  Turn  Order  is  referenced  to  organize  the  sequence  of  actions.   See  rule  375.  Triggered  Abilities  for  more  information.  
304.  The  Turn  Player  is  the  player  taking  the  current  turn.  
305.  When  there  are  no  items  on  the  Chain  and  the  Turn  Player  cannot  or  chooses  not  to  perform  any  Discretionary  Actions ,  the  current  phase  or  step  of  the  turn  ends  and  the  next  phase,  step,  or  turn  begins.  
306.  The  Turn  Player  changes  when  the  current  Turn  Player  reaches  the  End  of  all  of  the  Phases  of  their  Turn.  
307.  States  of  the  Turn

351.  1.  Remove  the  card  from  the  zone  you  are  playing  it  from  and  put  it  onto  the  Chain.  
351.1.  This  Closes  the  State.   See  rule  307.  States  of  the  Turn  for  more  information.  
351.2.  This  item  becomes  Pending.  
351.3.  If  another  Card  Effect  or  ability  is  currently  resolving,  continue  resolving  it  before  proceeding  with  any  further  steps  of  this  process.

## Page 31

352.  2.  Make  necessary  choices.  
352.1.  If  the  card  is  a  spell,  or  has  an  effect  that  speciﬁes  a  choice  "As  I  am  played,"  those  choices  are  made  now.  
352.2.  For  Units ,  choose  a  valid  Location  where  that  Unit  will  be  placed  upon  being  Played.  
352.2.a  By  default,  Valid  locations  include  the  controller’s  Base  or  a  Battleﬁeld  the  controller  controls.  
352.2.b  Some  Game  Effects  may  grant  players  permission  to  play  Units  to  locations  that  are  not  normally  Valid .  Such  locations  become  Valid  for  the  purposes  of  Playing  the  Unit. .  
352.3.  For  Spells  and  Abilities  that  Move  one  or  more  Units ,  choose  a  valid  Location  as  the  Move  Destination  for  each  Move  that  will  be  performed.  
352.4.  If  a  card  requires  you  to  speciﬁcally  choose  one  or  more  Game  Objects ,  that  choice  is  made  now.  
352.4.a.  This  does  not  include  cards  that  affect  one  or  more  Game  Objects  based  on  criteria.   Example:  "Stun  a  unit  at  a  battleﬁeld"  is  a  Choice.    Example:  "Kill  all  gear"  is  not  a  Choice.  
352.4.b.  This  does  not  include  making  choices  for  Triggered  Abilities  of  permanents,  even  if  those  abilities  trigger  when  the  permanent  is  played.   Example:  A  unit  with  a  triggered  ability  that  says  "When  I'm  played,  kill  a  unit"  does  not  require  you  to  choose  a  target  as  it's  played.  The  target  will  be  chosen  when  the  ability  triggers.    See  rule  375.  Triggered  Abilities  for  more  information.  
352.5.  Targeting  
352.6.  When  a  card  Chooses  one  or  more  speciﬁc  Game  Objects  to  affect,  it  is  Targeted.  
352.7.  In  order  to  put  a  spell  or  ability  on  the  chain,  valid  choices  must  be  made  for  all  targets.  
352.8.  A  target  is  a  valid  choice  if  it  meets  all  of  the  following  requirements:  
352.8.a.  It  is  a  permanent  or  rune  on  the  board,  a  spell  or  ability  on  the  chain,  a  player  or  zone,  or  speciﬁed  explicitly  or  implicitly  as  being  in  some  other  zone.   e.g.,  “Kill  a  unit”  targets  a  unit  on  the  board.   e.g.,  “Recycle  a  unit  from  your  trash”  targets  a  unit  card  in  your  trash.  
352.8.a.1.  “Unit,”  “gear,”  and  “rune”  refer  to  objects  on  the  Board  unless  speciﬁed  otherwise.  
352.8.a.2.  “Spell”  and  “ability”  refer  to  objects  on  the  Chain  unless  speciﬁed  otherwise.  
352.8.a.3.  “Facedown  card”  refers  to  a  card  in  a  Facedown  Zone  unless  speciﬁed  otherwise.  
352.8.a.4.  “Legend”  refers  to  a  legend  in  the  Legend  Zone.  
352.8.a.5.  “Chosen  Champion”  and  “unit  in  the  Champion  Zone”  refer  to  a  unit  in  the  Champion  Zone  unless  speciﬁed  otherwise.  
352.8.b.  It  meets  all  targeting  restrictions.   e.g.,  A  unit  is  a  valid  target  for  a  spell  that  refers  to  a  “unit  at  a  battleﬁeld,”  “enemy  unit,”  “unit  you  control,”  or  “unit  with  Might  4  or  greater”  only  if  it  meets  the  appropriate  criteria.

## Page 32

352.8.c.  It  is  not  the  spell  or  ability  itself.   e.g.,  A  spell  that  says  “Counter  a  spell”  cannot  target  itself.   e.g.,  An  ability  of  a  permanent  can  target  that  permanent,  because  abilities  and  their  sources  are  separate  objects.  
352.9.  If  a  spell  or  ability  requires  one  or  more  players  to  choose  objects,  players,  or  zones  that  are  not  targets,  those  choices  are  made  on  resolution.  
352.9.a.  Passive  abilities  never  have  targets.  
352.9.b.  Replacement  effects  never  have  targets.  
352.9.c.  Units  and  gear  never  have  targets,  although  their  abilities  may.  
352.10.  A  game  object,  player,  or  zone  mentioned  in  the  text  of  a  spell,  activated  ability,  or  triggered  ability  is  a  target  UNLESS  any  of  the  following  are  true:  
352.10.a.  It  is  in  a  zone  whose  information  status  is  not  Public.   e.g.,  “Ready  a  legend”  targets  a  legend,  because  the  Legend  Zone  is  Public.   e.g.,  “Return  a  unit  from  your  trash  to  your  hand”  targets  a  unit  card  in  your  trash,  because  your  trash  is  Public.   e.g.,  “You  may  play  a  unit  from  your  hand,  ignoring  its  costs”  does  not  target  a  unit  card  in  your  hand,  because  your  hand  is  not  a  public  zone.  
352.10.a.1.  Public  zones  are  Battleﬁeld  Zones,  Bases,  Trashes,  Legend  Zones,  Champion  Zones,  and  Facedown  Zones.  
352.10.b.  It  is  included  only  as  part  of  a  targeting  restriction  for  another  choice.   e.g.,  “Kill  a  unit  at  a  battleﬁeld”  targets  a  unit,  but  not  a  battleﬁeld,  because  the  units  are  targets  and  “at  a  battleﬁeld”  is  a  restriction.   e.g.,  “Kill  all  units  at  a  battleﬁeld”  targets  a  battleﬁeld,  but  not  any  units.  e.g.,  “Move  a  unit  to  a  battleﬁeld”  targets  both  a  unit  and  a  battleﬁeld.  
352.10.c.  It  is  included  only  as  part  of  a  cost,  trigger  condition,  or  replacement  effect.   e.g.,  “As  an  additional  cost  to  play  me,  kill  a  friendly  unit”  doesn’t  target  anything.   e.g.,  “When  a  friendly  unit  dies,  kill  a  gear”  targets  a  gear,  but  not  a  friendly  unit.   e.g.,  “When  you  play  me,  the  next  time  a  friendly  unit  would  die  this  turn,  return  it  to  your  hand  instead”  doesn’t  target  anything.  The  replacement  effect  applies  when  any  friendly  unit  dies.   e.g.,  “Choose  a  friendly  unit.  The  next  time  it  would  die  this  turn,  return  it  to  your  hand  instead”  targets  a  friendly  unit,  because  “choose  a  friendly  unit”  is  not  part  of  the  replacement  effect.  
352.10.c.1.  This  includes  costs  within  instructions,  identiﬁed  by  phrases  like  “[do  X]  to  [do  Y].”  The  cost  within  that  instruction  is  “[do  X].”   e.g.,  “When  I  hold,  you  may  kill  another  friendly  unit  here  to  draw  1”  does  not  target  anything.   e.g.,  “When  you  play  me,  you  may  spend  a  buff  to  move  a  friendly  unit”  targets  the  friendly  unit,  but  not  the  buff.

## Page 33

352.10.d.  It  is  programmatically  selected  based  on  its  characteristics  rather  than  chosen  by  the  spell  or  ability’s  controller.   e.g.,  “Kill  all  units  at  a  battleﬁeld”  targets  a  battleﬁeld,  but  does  not  target  any  units.   e.g.,  “Kill  all  units  at  battleﬁelds”  doesn’t  target  anything.   e.g.,  “Destroy  a  unit.  Its  controller  draws  2  cards”  targets  the  unit,  but  not  its  controller.   e.g.,  “Ready  your  legend”  doesn’t  target  anything,  because  you  can  only  have  one  legend.  e.g.,  “Ready  a  friendly  legend”  targets  a  legend,  because  in  a  2v2  game  there  are  two  friendly  legends.   e.g.,  “Recycle  all  cards  in  your  trash”  doesn’t  target  anything,  because  it  affects  all  cards  and  you  only  have  one  trash.  
352.10.d.1.  This  exception  applies  solely  to  objects  for  which  no  choice  is  ever  possible.  
352.10.d.2.  This  exception  does  not  apply  to  objects  that  are  the  only  valid  choice  at  the  moment  a  spell  or  ability  is  placed  on  the  chain,  but  which  would  require  a  choice  under  other  circumstances.   e.g.,  “Kill  a  unit  at  a  battleﬁeld”  always  targets  a  unit,  even  if  that  unit  is  the  only  unit  currently  at  a  battleﬁeld.  
352.10.e.  It  is  part  of  a  set  of  objects  chosen  in  whole  or  in  part  by  other  players.   e.g.,  “Each  player  kills  a  unit  they  control”  does  not  target.  Each  player,  including  the  one  who  played  the  spell,  chooses  a  unit  to  kill  as  the  spell  or  ability  resolves.  
352.10.f.  It  is  identiﬁed  in  an  instruction  that  a  player  “must”  complete.   e.g.,  “You  must  recycle  one  of  your  runes”  doesn’t  target  anything.  You  choose  from  among  your  runes  as  the  spell  or  ability  resolves.   e.g.,  “Recycle  a  rune  you  control”  targets  a  rune.  You  choose  a  rune  you  control  as  you  put  the  spell  or  ability  on  the  chain.  
352.11.  Some  cards  identify  a  group  of  Targets  with  Targeting  Requirements  that  must  be  met  by  the  group  as  a  whole.  
352.11.a.  As  they’re  ﬁnalized  on  the  chain,  such  cards  can  choose  any  group  of  valid  targets  that  collectively  fulﬁll  the  targeting  restriction.  
352.11.b.  If  the  group  of  targets  no  longer  collectively  fulﬁll  the  targeting  restriction  as  the  spell  or  ability  resolves,  that  spell  or  ability’s  controller  can  choose  a  subset  of  the  original  targets  that  fulﬁlls  the  targeting  requirement  for  the  spell  or  ability  to  affect.   Example:  A  player  plays  Fox-Fire,  a  spell  that  says  in  part  “Kill  any  number  of  units  at  a  battleﬁeld  with  total  Might  4  or  less.”  That  player  chooses  four  1  [M]  Recruit  tokens  at  a  single  battleﬁeld.  As  a  Reaction,  another  player  gives  two  of  those  Recruits  +1  [M],  so  the  Recruits’  Mights  are  1,  1,  2,  and  2.  Then  Fox-Fire  resolves.  The  Recruits  no  longer  have  total  Might  4  or  less,  so  Fox-Fire’s  controller  must  choose  a  legal  subset  of  the  original  targets  to  affect.  They  could  choose  to  kill  the  two  2  [M]  Recruits,  or  the  two  1  [M]  Recruits  plus  one  2  [M]  Recruit.  The  units  they  choose  are  Fox-Fire’s  remaining  legal  targets.  They  can’t  choose  to  affect  units  at  the  same  battleﬁeld  that  weren’t  initially  chosen  as  targets,  and  they  can’t  affect  any  units  that  are  no  longer  at  the  chosen  battleﬁeld.  
352.12.  If  a  card  speciﬁes  that  a  player  may  choose  some  number  of  Game  Objects  to  be  affected  by  a  card,  then  all  choices  are  considered  targeted  and  chosen  independently.  
352.13.  If  a  card  speciﬁes  that  a  player  chooses  “any  number”  or  “up  to”  some  number  of  Game  Objects  to  be  affected,  they  may  choose  any  number  of  available  targets,  including  zero.  If  they  choose  zero,  the  spell  or  ability  can  be  played  without  any  targets.  
352.14.  Splitting

## Page 34

352.14.a.  If  a  card  speciﬁes  that  an  amount  of  damage  may  be  split  among  some  number  of  Units ,  then  each  Unit  chosen  is  Targeted.  
352.14.b.  The  Targets  are  chosen  when  the  spell  or  ability  is  ﬁnalized  on  the  chain.  
352.14.c.  A  number  of  Targets  can  only  be  chosen  up  to,  and  not  exceeding,  the  initial  amount  of  damage  available  when  the  spell  is  played.  Example:  A  player  playing  a  spell  that  instructs  them  to  "Split  5  damage"  may  only  choose  up  to  5  units,  but  may  choose  fewer.  
352.14.d.  Each  Target  is  valid,  and  contributes  to  Chosen  triggers  individually.  
352.14.e.  The  choice  of  how  much  damage  is  divided  across  the  split  is  not  decided  until  the  resolution  of  the  spell  or  ability.  
352.14.f.  Each  Target  must  receive  a  valid  amount  of  damage.  
352.14.g.  Valid  damage  is  a  positive  integer  amount,  greater  than  or  equal  to  1  damage.  
352.14.h.  If,  at  resolution  of  the  spell  or  effect,  there  are  more  Targets  than  available  damage  to  divide,  then  the  player  who  controls  the  effect  dealing  damage  determines  which  Targets  cease  being  Targets.  
352.14.i.  Any  costs  that  were  paid,  or  effects  that  were  triggered  as  a  result  of  those  Game  Objects  being  chosen  as  Targets  remain  in  effect,  paid,  or  otherwise  triggered.  
352.15.  These  choices  cannot  be  changed  after  this  step.  
352.16.  A  player  may  not  make  choices  during  this  step  that  will  deterministically  result  in  illegal  choices  or  actions  later  in  this  process  unless  they  have  no  choice.   Example:  A  player  plays  Cruel  Patron,  which  says  "As  an  additional  cost  to  play  me,  kill  a  friendly  unit."  They  control  exactly  one  unit,  which  is  at  a  battleﬁeld.  They  can't  choose  to  play  Cruel  Patron  to  that  battleﬁeld,  because  by  the  time  they  have  ﬁnished  paying  costs,  they  will  no  longer  control  that  battleﬁeld.  
353.  3.  Determine  Total  Cost.  
353.1.  If  an  ability  or  instruction  allows  you  to  "ignore"  one  or  more  of  a  card's  costs,  set  the  appropriate  Base  Cost(s)  of  the  card  to  zero.  
353.1.a.  If  a  card  allows  a  player  to  play  a  card  "ignoring  its  cost,"  its  base  Energy  cost  and  base  Power  cost  are  set  to  zero.  
353.1.b.  If  a  card  instructs  a  player  to  play  a  card  "ignoring  its  Energy  cost"  or  "ignoring  its  Power  cost,"  only  the  appropriate  cost  is  set  to  zero,  and  the  remaining  cost  still  applies.  
353.1.c.  Further  additional  costs  and/or  cost  increases  applied  in  subsequent  steps  may  raise  the  card's  Total  Cost  above  zero.   Example:  Legion  Rearguard  is  a  Fury  unit  that  costs  2  Energy  and  0  Power  and  has  Accelerate.  A  player  plays  Legion  Rearguard  and  is  instructed  to  ignore  its  costs,  but  chooses  to  pay  the  Accelerate  cost.  They  ignore  Legion  Rearguard's  Base  Cost  of  2  Energy,  but  the  optional  additional  cost  of  1  Energy  and  1  Fury  Power  is  added  to  its  Total  Cost  and  must  be  paid.  
353.2.  Apply  additional  costs  in  any  order.  
353.2.a.  Mandatory  Additional  Costs  
353.2.a.1.  Some  Additional  Costs  speciﬁed  by  Passive  Abilities  on  the  card  being  played  or  another  card  are  Mandatory ,  and  must  be  paid  to  complete  playing  the  card.  They  use  the  phrase  "as  an  additional  cost"  and  don't  include  the  word  "may."   Example:  A  unit  has  the  passive  ability  "As  an  additional  cost  to  play  me,  kill  a  friendly  unit."  To  play  that  unit,  a  player  must  kill  a  friendly  unit.

## Page 35

See  rule  360.  Passive  Abilities  for  more  information.  
353.2.a.2.  The  cost  imposed  by  the  Deﬂect  keyword  is  a  Mandatory  Additional  Cost.   See  rule  735.  Deﬂect  for  more  information.  
353.2.b.  Optional  Additional  Costs  
353.2.b.1.  Some  Optional  Costs  speciﬁed  by  Passive  Abilities  on  the  card  being  played  or  another  card  are  Non-Mandatory ,  and  must  be  paid  only  if  the  player  made  the  choice  to  pay  them  in  rule  352.  They  use  the  phrase  "as  an  additional  cost"  and  the  word  "may."   Example:  A  unit  has  the  ability  "As  you  play  me,  you  may  discard  1  as  an  additional  cost.  If  you  do,  reduce  my  cost  by  [2]."  While  playing  the  unit,  its  controller  declares  their  intention  to  pay  the  additional  cost  in  rule  352 ,  applies  that  additional  cost  in  rule  353.2 ,  applies  the  discount  granted  by  paying  that  cost  in  rule  353.4 ,  and  discards  a  card  to  pay  that  additional  cost  in  rule  354.2.     See  rule  360.  Passive  Abilities  for  more  information.  
353.3.  Apply  cost  increases.  
353.4.  Apply  discounts  in  any  order.  
353.4.a.  Discounts  may  be  applied  by  the  card  being  played  or  by  any  other  card  or  effect.  
353.4.b.  Discounts  may  say  that  cards  "cost  [amount]  less"  or  that  one  or  more  of  their  costs  are  "reduced  by  [amount]."  
353.4.c.  If  a  discount  applies  a  minimum  cost,  that  minimum  applies  only  to  that  discount.   Example:  Eager  Apprentice  says  "While  I'm  at  a  battleﬁeld,  the  Energy  costs  for  spells  you  play  is  reduced  by  [1],  to  a  minimum  of  [1]."  A  player  who  controls  Eager  Apprentice  and  a  unit  with  7  Might  plays  Sky  Splitter,  a  spell  that  costs  8  Energy  and  says  "This  spell's  Energy  cost  is  reduced  by  the  highest  Might  among  units  you  control."  That  player  can  choose  to  apply  Eager  Apprentice's  discount  ﬁrst,  reducing  Sky  Splitter's  Energy  cost  to  7,  then  apply  Sky  Splitter's  discount,  reducing  its  Energy  cost  to  0.  If  they  applied  these  discounts  in  the  other  order,  Sky  Splitter's  Energy  cost  would  be  1.  
353.4.d.  Discounts  can  reduce  additional  costs,  including  to  0.  
353.4.d.1.  An  optional  additional  cost  was  "paid"  if  the  player  made  the  decision  in  rule  352  to  pay  it.  It  doesn't  matter  how  much  the  player  actually  paid.  Example:  Clockwork  Keeper  is  a  unit  that  costs  2  Energy  and  0  Power  and  says  "As  you  play  me,  you  may  pay  [C]  as  an  additional  cost.  If  you  do,  draw  "  A  player  controls  a  card  that  says  "Units  you  play  cost  [A]  less."  That  player  plays  Clockwork  Keeper  and  chooses  to  pay  the  optional  additional  cost  of  [C].  They  will  draw  a  card,  even  though  the  optional  additional  cost  was  reduced  to  0.  
353.5.  Energy  and  Power  costs  can't  be  reduced  below  0.  
353.6.  Costs  may  be  Energy  costs,  Power  costs,  or  non-standard  costs.  Example:  A  card  reads  "As  an  additional  cost  to  play  me,  kill  a  friendly  unit."  Killing  a  friendly  unit  is  an  additional  cost  to  play  that  card.  
354.  4.  Pay  the  card's  costs.  
354.1.  In  total,  pay  the  combined  Energy  cost  (if  any)  and  Power  cost  (if  any).

## Page 36

354.1.a.  During  this  step,  the  spell's  controller  can  use  activated  abilities  with  the  Reaction  tag  that  Add  resources  to  add  Energy  and  Power  to  pay  the  spell's  costs.   See  rule  161.  Rune  Pools  and  rule  416.  Add  for  more  information.  
354.2.  In  addition,  pay  any  non-standard  Cost  summed  in  rule  353.2  in  any  order.  
354.2.a.  Costs  that  are  replaced  with  other  events  by  replacement  effects  are  still  considered  paid.   Example:  A  player  plays  Cruel  Patron,  which  says  "As  an  additional  cost  to  play  me,  kill  a  friendly  unit."  They  also  control  Zhonya’s  Hourglass,  which  says  “If  a  friendly  unit  would  die,  kill  this  instead.  Heal  that  unit,  exhaust  it,  and  recall  it.”  They  choose  to  kill  a  friendly  unit  during  rule  353.2 ,  but  as  they  pay  the  cost  in  rule  354.2 ,  Zhonya’s  Hourglass  replaces  that  unit’s  death.  The  cost  is  considered  paid,  and  the  player  can  continue  playing  Cruel  Patron.  
354.3.  A  player  may  not  pay  costs  during  this  step  that  will  deterministically  result  in  illegal  choices  or  actions  later  in  this  process  unless  they  have  no  choice.   Example:  A  player  plays  Cruel  Patron,  which  says  "As  an  additional  cost  to  play  me,  kill  a  friendly  unit."  They  control  multiple  units,  one  of  which  is  alone  at  a  battleﬁeld.  During  rule  352.2. ,  they  chose  to  play  Cruel  Patron  to  that  battleﬁeld.  While  paying  costs,  they  can't  choose  to  kill  the  unit  at  that  battleﬁeld,  because  then  they  will  no  longer  control  that  battleﬁeld  and  Cruel  Patron  cannot  legally  be  played  there.  If  they  controlled  that  battleﬁeld  with  multiple  units,  any  of  those  units  would  be  a  legal  choice,  because  they  would  still  control  the  battleﬁeld  after  killing  one.  
355.  5.  Check  legality.  
355.1.  Check  that  all  chosen  targets  are  legal.  
355.2.  Ensure  that  the  outcome  of  the  effect  of  this  card  being  played  would  not  create  an  illegal  state.   Example:  Check  that  a  spell's  execution  does  not  create  a  state  where  a  Battleﬁeld  has  Units  controlled  by  3  different  players.  
355.3.  If  the  card,  if  continued  to  be  played,  would  create  an  illegal  state,  or  if  a  choice  or  action  at  this  state  is  illegal,  the  actions  taken  in  this  process  are  undone  and  the  action  is  cancelled.  
356.  6.  Finalize  this  card  and  proceed  with  the  card's  category  of  Play.  
356.1.  This  card  is  no  longer  Pending .  
356.2.  A  Permanent  leaves  the  Chain  and  becomes  a  Game  Object.  
356.2.a.  Any  passive  abilities  become  active.  
356.2.b.  Execute  all  rules  text  on  the  card,  from  top  to  bottom.  
356.2.c.  If  it  is  a  Unit ,  it  enters  the  Board  exhausted  at  the  Location  that  was  chosen.  
356.2.d.  If  it  is  a  Gear,  it  enters  the  Board  Ready  at  the  player's  Base.  
356.3.  A  Spell  lingers  on  the  Chain.  
356.3.a.  This  card  becomes  a  Finalized  Chain  Item.  
356.3.b.  If  there  are  other  Pending  Items  on  the  Chain,  then  the  controller  of  those  Pending  Items  completes  Steps  2  through  5  of  Playing  Cards  for  those  items  before  continuing.   See  rule  326.  Chains  for  more  information .  
356.3.c.  Other  players  have  an  opportunity  to  play  Reactions  before  the  resolution  of  spells.   See  rule  326.  Chains  for  more  information.  
356.3.d.  Otherwise,  execute  the  game  effect  of  the  spell,  from  top  to  bottom  of  the  rules  text  of  the  card  and  then  place  the  card  in  the  Trash  of  the  owning  player.

356.3.e.  Handling  illegal  and  impossible  instructions  
356.3.e.1.  The  spell  resolves  even  if  some  or  all  of  its  targets  are  illegal.  
356.3.e.2.  A  target  is  illegal  as  the  spell  resolves  if  it  no  longer  meets  the  targeting  requirements  of  the  spell,  or  if  it  has  changed  Zones  to  or  from  a  Non-Board  Zone.  
356.3.e.3.  If  a  target  ceases  to  meet  the  targeting  requirements  while  the  spell  is  on  the  chain,  then  meets  them  again,  it's  a  legal  target.   Example:  A  spell  targets  "a  unit  at  a  battleﬁeld."  A  player  reacts  with  a  spell  that  moves  the  unit  to  base,  then  another  player  reacts  with  a  spell  that  moves  it  back  to  that  battleﬁeld,  then  the  original  spell  resolves.  The  unit  is  a  legal  target.  
356.3.e.4.  If  a  target  changes  Zones  to  or  from  a  Non-Board  Zone  and  then  returns  to  its  original  zone,  it  is  no  longer  a  legal  target,  because  it's  not  treated  as  the  same  object.   Examples:   An  enemy  unit  at  a  battleﬁeld  is  no  longer  a  legal  target  if  it  is  no  longer  an  enemy,  no  longer  a  unit,  or  no  longer  at  a  battleﬁeld.    A  unit  with  3  or  less  Might  is  no  longer  a  legal  target  if  it  is  no  longer  a  unit  or  if  its  Might  is  greater  than  3.    Something  that's  exhausted  is  no  longer  a  legal  target  if  it  is  no  longer  exhausted.  (It  can't  stop  being  "something.")    A  spell  that's  played  from  hidden  can  normally  only  target  its  own  battleﬁeld  or  something  at  that  battleﬁeld.  A  target  for  such  a  spell  may  cease  to  be  a  legal  target  if  it  moves  from  the  battleﬁeld  where  that  spell  was  played,  even  if  the  spell  has  no  location  targeting  requirement  otherwise.  
356.3.e.5.  If  any  of  the  spell's  targets  are  no  longer  legal,  those  targets  are  unaffected  by  the  spell  as  it  resolves.   Example:  A  player  plays  Void  Seeker,  a  spell  that  says  "Deal  4  to  a  unit  at  a  battleﬁeld.  Draw  1."  The  unit's  controller  uses  a  Reaction  to  move  the  unit  to  their  base.  Since  the  unit  is  no  longer  a  legal  target,  it  is  not  dealt  any  damage.  Void  Seeker's  controller  still  draws  1.  
356.3.e.6.  Instructions  that  can't  be  followed,  either  because  of  illegal  targets  or  other  circumstances,  are  ignored.  
356.3.e.7.  If  all  of  an  instruction's  Targets  become  Invalid  or  Unavailable  by  the  time  the  spell  is  ﬁnished  being  played,  that  instruction  will  not  execute.  
356.3.e.8.  If  an  instruction  has  more  than  one  Target  and  fewer  than  all  of  the  Targets  become  Invalid  or  Unavailable  by  the  time  the  spell  is  ﬁnished  being  played,  the  instruction  will  execute,  with  only  the  Targets  available  and  valid  being  operated  on.  
356.3.e.9.  The  process  for  a  card's  choice  becoming  Invalid  or  Unavailable  is  referred  to  as  mistargeting.   Example:  A  spell  has  the  instruction  "Deal  2  to  a  unit  at  a  battleﬁeld."  Before  that  instruction  can  execute,  the  chosen  unit  is  moved  to  its  base.  The  instruction  will  not  be  executed,  because  it  speciﬁes  that  the  unit  it  chooses  must  be  at  a  Battleﬁeld,  and  by  the  time  it  attempted  to  execute,  the  unit  was  no  longer  valid  as  a  choice.

## Page 38

356.3.e.10.  It  is  possible  for  none  of  a  spell's  instructions  to  be  executed  as  it  resolves,  due  to  all  of  them  requiring  targets  to  act  on  and  all  of  those  targets  becoming  Invalid  or  Unavailable .  In  this  case,  the  spell  has  no  effect  but  is  still  considered  played.   Example:  A  player  plays  a  spell  that  reads  "Deal  2  to  a  unit  at  a  battleﬁeld"  with  no  other  instructions,  and  chooses  an  enemy  unit  at  a  battleﬁeld.  They  also  control  a  unit  with  the  ability  "When  you  play  a  spell,  give  me  +1  [M]  this  turn."  Before  the  spell  resolves,  the  chosen  unit  is  moved  to  its  base.  The  spell  resolves  and  its  only  instruction  cannot  be  executed,  but  the  unit's  ability  still  triggers  as  the  spell  resolves  and  gives  it  +1  [M].  
356.3.e.11.  Instructions  that  can  be  partially  followed  are  followed  as  much  as  possible  and  ignored  otherwise.   Example:  A  player  plays  a  spell  that  says  "Discard  2,  then  draw  2"  If  their  hand  is  empty,  the  instruction  to  discard  2  will  be  ignored.  They'll  still  draw  2.  If  they  had  1  card  in  hand,  they  would  discard  it  and  draw  2.  
356.3.e.12.  If  the  spell  checks  information  about  a  target  that  is  no  longer  legal  or  a  card  or  permanent  whose  location,  zone,  or  status  has  changed  such  that  that  information  is  no  longer  available,  that  check  returns  "null"  and  all  calculations  based  on  it  are  ignored.   Examples:   A  unit  that  is  no  longer  on  the  board  is  treated  as  having  null  Might,  null  cost,  etc.    A  unit  that  is  no  longer  on  the  board  has  no  location,  is  neither  exhausted  nor  readied,  etc.    Baited  Hook  says  "[1][C],  [E]:  Kill  a  friendly  unit.  Look  at  the  top  5  cards  of  your  Main  Deck.  You  may  banish  a  unit  from  among  them  that  has  Might  up  to  1  more  than  the  killed  unit  and  play  it,  ignoring  its  cost.  Then  recycle  the  rest."  While  Baited  Hook’s  ability  is  on  the  chain,  an  opponent  reacts  with  a  spell  that  returns  the  friendly  unit  to  its  owner's  hand.  Because  the  friendly  unit  is  no  longer  a  legal  target,  it  can't  be  killed  and  its  Might  is  treated  as  null.  Baited  Hook’s  controller  reveals  the  top  5  cards  of  their  Main  Deck,  but  can’t  choose  any  unit  from  among  them.  
356.3.e.13.  A  spell  or  ability  that  moves  something  to  a  different  zone  as  a  cost  or  effect  can  "look  back"  at  its  characteristics  before  it  changes  zones.  
357.  Abilities  
358.  An  Ability  is  the  structured  rules  and  capabilities  of  Game  Objects  or  Spells.  
358.1.  An  Ability  has  multiple  structures.   Passive  Abilities   Replacement  Effects   Activated  Abilities   Triggered  Abilities   Delayed  Abilities  
359.  A  card  can  have  more  than  one  Ability  and  more  than  one  type  of  Ability.  
360.  Passive  Abilities  
361.  Conditions,  rules,  constraints,  or  statements  that  affect  the  course  of  regular  play.  
361.1.  These  abilities  have  a  wide  variety  of  formats  to  recognize.   Example:  "I  get  +1[M]  while  you  have  2  or  more  cards  in  your  hand."

## Page 39

Example:  "Friendly  Yordles  at  my  battleﬁeld  have  [Shield]."  
361.2.  They  can  be  recognized  by  being  statements  of  fact.  
361.3.  Passive  Abilities  can  be  conditional.  
361.3.a.  Conditional  Passive  Abilities  can  be  recognized  by  the  occurrence  of  "if"  or  "while"  as  part  of  the  statement  of  the  ability.   Example:  " While  I'm  attacking  or  defending  alone,  I  have  +2  [M]."    Example:  " If  an  opponent  controls  a  battleﬁeld,  I  enter  ready."  
362.  Presence  on  Permanents  
362.1.  Passive  Abilities  of  Permanents  are  typically  only  active  while  on  the  Board.  
363.  Presence  on  Card  outside  of  the  Board  
363.1.  Passive  Abilities  of  cards  in  zones  that  are  outside  of  the  Board  will  self-describe  their  context.   Example:  The  passive  ability  "Play  me  only  during  an  opponent's  turn."  applies  in  any  zone  from  which  that  card  can  be  played.  
363.2.  Passive  Abilities  can  alter  the  costs  of  cards  as  they  are  played.  
363.2.a.  These  apply  at  all  times  in  any  zone  from  which  the  card  with  the  ability  can  be  played.  
364.  Replacement  Effects  
365.  An  ability  that  alters  the  application  of  another  game  effect  or  game  rule.  
365.1.  Passive  Abilities  can  be  Replacement  Effects.  
366.  Replacement  Effects  intercede  during  the  execution  of  a  Game  Effect  and  alter  its  execution.  
366.1.  A  Replacement  Effect  can  be  identiﬁed  by  the  presence  of  the  term  "instead."   Example:  Zhonya's  Hourglass  reads  "The  next  time  a  friendly  unit  would  die,  kill  this  instead.  Recall  that  unit  exhausted."  This  is  a  replacement  effect  that  alters  the  execution  of  any  Game  Effect  that  would  kill  a  friendly  unit.  
367.  A  Replacement  Effect  can  alter  the  typical  ﬂow  of  play,  including  other  cards'  executions.  
368.  If  more  than  one  Replacement  Effect  applies  to  the  same  event  being  executed,  then  the  owner  of  the  object  being  acted  on  determines  the  order  the  Replacement  Effects  will  apply.  
368.1.  If  it  is  a  player  being  acted  on,  that  player  decides  the  order  the  Replacement  Effects  will  apply.  
368.2.  If  the  affected  object  is  an  Uncontrolled  Battleﬁeld  then  the  Current  Turn  Player  decides  the  order  the  Replacement  Effects  will  apply.  
369.  Activated  Abilities  
370.  Activated  Abilities  are  repeatable  effects  with  a  cost.  They  follow  a  process  of  going  onto  the  chain  and  resolving,  similar  to  Playing  a  Card.   See  rule  346.  Playing  Cards  for  more  information.  
370.1.  Activated  Abilities  are  recognized  by  the  presence  of  a  ":"  in  the  text  of  the  card,  preceded  by  a  cost  and  succeeded  by  an  effect.   Example:  "[2]:  Draw  1"  is  an  activated  ability.  The  cost  is  2  energy.  The  effect  is  to  draw  1  card.  
370.2.  Activated  Abilities  use  the  chain.  
370.2.a.  Declare  activation  of  the  Ability.

## Page 40

370.2.a.1.  The  ability  goes  on  the  chain  but  has  no  card  to  represent  it,  so  players  need  to  take  note  that  it  is  now  a  Closed  State.  
370.2.b.  Proceed  with  executing  the  Chain.  
370.2.b.1.  Follow  the  steps  of  “Playing  or  Activating  Abilities”  in  rule  386 .  This  ability  will  become  a  Pending  Chain  Item.  
370.2.b.2.  Opponents  have  an  opportunity  to  respond,  as  appropriate,  as  if  a  card  was  played  onto  the  chain.  
370.2.b.3.  If  no  further  action  is  taken,  execute  the  Activated  Ability.  
371.  The  controlling  player  chooses  when  and  whether  to  activate  an  Activated  Ability.  
372.  Activated  abilities  are  present  on  Game  Objects  and  some  Spells.  
373.  Can  primarily  be  activated  while  on  the  Board.  
374.  All  Activated  Abilities  can  only  be  activated  on  the  Controlling  Player's  Turn  and  during  an  Open  State.  
375.  Triggered  Abilities  
376.  Triggered  Abilities  are  repeatable  effects  that  happen  when  a  Condition  is  met.  
376.1.  Triggered  Abilities  can  usually  be  recognized  by  the  word  "when"  followed  by  a  game  action  or  event;  the  word  "at"  followed  by  a  point  in  time  during  the  turn  sequence;  or  the  phrase  “the  [Nth]  time”  followed  by  a  game  action  or  event.   Examples:   " When  you  conquer  here,  you  may  spend  a  buff  to  draw  1."    "At  the  end  of  your  turn,  ready  2  runes."    “The  ﬁrst  time  I  move  each  turn,  you  may  ready  something  else  that's  exhausted.”  
376.1.a.  The  phrases  that  identify  triggered  abilities  do  not  always  appear  at  the  beginning  of  sentences  or  abilities.  
376.1.b.  If  an  ability  triggers  “the  [Nth]  time”  something  happens  and  that  trigger  condition  is  met  multiple  times  simultaneously,  the  ability’s  controller  picks  one  of  those  instances  to  serve  as  the  trigger  condition.  The  ability  triggers  only  once,  due  to  the  chosen  condition.   Example:  Wraith  of  Echoes  reads  “The  ﬁrst  time  another  friendly  unit  dies  each  turn,  draw  1.”  That  ability  hasn’t  triggered  yet  this  turn.  Two  other  friendly  units  die  simultaneously  (say,  due  to  combat  damage).  The  Wraith’s  controller  chooses  one  of  those  deaths  to  trigger  Wraith’s  ability.  
376.2.  Triggered  Abilities  have  a  Condition  and  an  Effect.  
376.2.a.  The  Condition  follows  the  When.  
376.2.b.  The  Effect  is  the  Instruction  that  follows  the  comma  after  the  Condition.  
376.2.c.  The  Condition  of  a  Trigger  is  evaluated  after  a  potentially  inciting  event  has  been  processed.  
376.2.c.1.  If  a  Game  Object  with  a  Triggered  Ability  that  is  active  in  a  speciﬁc  zone,  it  is  evaluated  and  subsequently  triggered  if  it  enters  that  zone  at  the  same  time  that  its  Trigger ’s  condition  is  met.   Example:  Immortal  Phoenix  says  “When  you  kill  a  unit  with  a  spell,  you  may  pay  [1][C]  to  play  me  from  your  trash.”  This  ability  triggers  if  Immortal  Phoenix  is  in  your  trash  immediately  after  you  kill  a  unit  with  a  spell,  even  if  the  unit  you  killed  with  a  spell  was  that  Immortal  Phoenix.

## Page 41

376.2.c.2.  A  Game  Object  will  not  be  able  to  successfully  be  able  to  evaluate  its  Trigger  Condition ,  however,  if  it  leaves  the  zone  that  its  Trigger  is  active  from  at  the  same  time  that  its  Trigger  is  satisﬁed.   Example:  Viktor,  Leader  says  “When  another  non-Recruit  unit  you  control  dies,  play  a  1  [M]  Recruit  unit  token  into  your  base.”  This  ability  triggers  if  Viktor  is  on  the  board  immediately  after  another  non-Recruit  unit  you  control  dies.  It  does  not  trigger  if  Viktor  and  another  non-Recruit  unit  you  control  die  during  the  same  game  action  (for  instance,  if  they  are  both  killed  in  the  same  Cleanup  due  to  the  damage  dealt  by  Unchecked  Power).  
376.3.  When  a  Condition  is  met,  a  Triggered  Ability  behaves  like  an  Activated  Ability  and  is  placed  on  the  Chain.  
376.3.a.  Triggered  Abilities  can  be  put  on  the  Chain  during  Closed  States  or  Open  States  on  any  player's  turn.  
376.3.b.  If  more  than  one  Triggered  Ability  is  Triggered  simultaneously,  then  the  player  that  controls  the  Abilities  selects  the  order  to  place  them  on  the  Chain.  
376.3.b.1.  If  multiple  players  separately  control  Triggered  Abilities  that  are  Triggered  simultaneously,  then  starting  with  the  Turn  Player  and  proceeding  in  Turn  Order ,  each  player  orders  their  Triggered  Abilities  on  the  Chain.  
376.4.  Some  Conditions  are  commonly  used  and  structured  in  a  way  that  explicitly  deﬁnes  their  use  and  other  properties  of  the  Effect  that  is  associated  with  it.  
376.4.a.  Play  Effects  are  Triggered  Abilities  with  the  Condition  that  the  Permanent  that  has  the  Play  Effect  being  played  to  the  board.  
376.4.a.1.  These  are  commonly  structured  as  “When  you  play  me…”  for  Units  and  “When  you  play  this…”  for  Gear.  
376.4.a.2.  These  Triggered  Abilities  are  put  on  the  Chain  as  Pending  Items  after  the  Permanent  these  effects  correspond  to  is  ﬁnalized  and  enters  the  board.  
376.4.a.3.  These  Triggered  Abilities  can  be  referred  to  as  Play  Effects.  
376.4.a.4.  Abilities  that  trigger  when  another  object  is  played  are  not  considered  Play  Effects.  
376.4.b.  Conquer  Effects  are  Triggered  Abilities  with  a  Condition  of  a  Unit  participating  in,  and  successfully  Conquering  a  Battleﬁeld.  
376.4.b.1.  These  are  commonly  structured  as  “When  I  conquer…”  and  “When  you  conquer…”  
376.4.b.2.  This  category  of  Triggered  Abilities  encompasses  only  those  that  are  triggered  from  Units  that  were  present  during  the  Conquer  action,  or  Abilities  that  reference  the  player  that  performed  the  Conquer  action.  
376.4.b.2.a.  The  Conquer  Abilities  of  Units  are  put  on  the  Chain  as  Pending  Items  after  the  Unit(s)  these  effects  correspond  to  are  present  at  a  Battleﬁeld  when  a  player  gains  control  of  it  and  gains  1  Victory  Point  from  Conquering.  
376.4.b.2.b.  The  Conquer  Abilities  of  anything  that  references  the  player  Conquering  is  put  on  the  Chain  as  a  Pending  Item  when  the  Condition  that  the  player  that  controls  the  triggering  source  has  performed  a  Conquer  and  gained  1  Victory  Point.  
376.4.b.2.c.  If  the  act  of  gaining  one  point  from  Conquering  is  negated  or  replaced  in  any  way,  the  Conquer  Effect  will  still  trigger.

## Page 42

376.4.b.3.  These  Triggered  Abilities  can  be  referred  to  as  Conquer  Effects.  
376.4.c.  Hold  Effects  are  Triggered  Abilities  with  a  Condition  of  a  Unit  being  present  at  a  Battleﬁeld  during  the  Beginning  phase  when  a  player  scores  Victory  Points  from  Holding.  
376.4.c.1.  These  are  commonly  structured  as  “When  I  hold…”  or  “When  you  hold…”  
376.4.c.2.  This  category  of  Triggered  Abilities  encompasses  only  those  that  are  triggered  from  Units  that  were  present  during  the  Hold  action,  or  Abilities  that  reference  the  player  that  performed  the  Hold  action.  
376.4.c.2.a.  The  Hold  Abilities  of  Units  are  put  on  the  Chain  as  Pending  Items  after  the  Unit  these  effects  correspond  to  are  present  at  a  Battleﬁeld  when  a  player  maintains  control  of  it  and  Gains  1  Victory  Point  during  their  Beginning  Phase  from  Holding.  
376.4.c.2.b.  The  Hold  Abilities  of  anything  that  references  the  player  Holding  is  put  on  the  Chain  as  a  Pending  Item  when  the  Condition  that  the  player  that  controls  the  triggering  source  has  performed  a  Hold  and  gained  1  Victory  Point.  
376.4.c.2.c.  If  the  act  of  gaining  one  point  from  Holding  is  negated  or  replaced  in  any  way,  the  Hold  Effect  will  still  trigger.  
376.4.c.3.  These  Triggered  Abilities  can  be  referred  to  as  Hold  Effects.  
376.4.d.  Attack  Triggers  are  Triggered  Abilities  that  trigger  when  a  Unit  gains  the  Attacker  designation  for  the  ﬁrst  time  during  a  combat.  
376.4.d.1.  These  are  commonly  structured  as  “When  I  attack…”  
376.4.d.2.  These  Triggered  Abilities  are  put  on  the  Chain  as  Pending  Items  after  the  Unit  these  effects  correspond  to  gains  the  Attacker  designation  during  Combat .  
376.4.d.2.a.  These  triggers  can  only  become  fulﬁlled  once  per  combat,  despite  a  Unit  being  able  to  gain  and  lose  the  Attacker  designation  multiple  times  in  the  same  combat.  
376.4.d.3.  These  Triggered  Abilities  can  be  referred  to  as  Attack  Triggers.  
376.4.e.  Defend  Triggers  are  Triggered  Abilities  that  trigger  when  a  Unit  gains  the  Defender  designation  for  the  ﬁrst  time  during  a  combat.  
376.4.e.1.  These  are  commonly  structured  as  “When  I  defend…”  
376.4.e.2.  These  Triggered  Abilities  are  put  on  the  Chain  as  Pending  Items  after  the  Unit  these  effects  correspond  to  gains  the  Defender  designation  during  Combat .  
376.4.e.2.a.  These  triggers  can  only  become  fulﬁlled  once  per  combat,  despite  a  Unit  being  able  to  gain  and  lose  the  Defender  designation  multiple  times  in  the  same  combat.  
376.4.e.3.  These  Triggered  Abilities  can  be  referred  to  as  Defend  Triggers.  
377.  Presence  on  Permanents  
377.1.  Typically  active  while  on  the  Board.  
377.2.  Triggered  Abilities  of  Permanents  are  only  able  to  have  their  Conditions  evaluated  while  on  the  Board.  
378.  Presence  on  Cards  outside  of  the  Board

378.1.  Triggered  Abilities  on  cards  outside  of  the  Board  rely  on  the  Information  Level  of  the  zone  they  are  in.  
378.2.  Triggered  Abilities  outside  of  the  Board  will  self-describe  their  context.   Example:  The  triggered  ability  "When  you  conquer,  you  may  discard  1  to  return  this  from  your  trash  to  your  hand."  triggers  while  the  card  it's  on  is  in  the  trash,  and  not  anywhere  else.  
379.  Reﬂexive  Triggers  
380.  Reﬂexive  Triggers  are  a  type  of  Triggered  Ability  that  create  one  or  more  Chain  Items  when  their  condition  is  met.  
380.1.  Reﬂexive  Triggers  can  be  recognized  by  the  phrase  “Do  this:”  or  “Do  one  of  the  following:”.  
380.1.a.  “Do  this”  can  be  followed  by  “N  times.”  The  Reﬂexive  Trigger  will  thus  be  added  to  the  chain  N  times  when  its  condition  is  met.  
380.2.  Reﬂexive  Triggers  will  be  preceded  by  their  conditions,  if  any.  If  no  condition  is  present  in  the  ability  then  the  Reﬂexive  Trigger  will  always  be  added  to  the  Chain.  
380.3.  If  present,  the  Condition  of  a  Reﬂexive  Trigger  will  follow  the  same  format  as  a  Triggered  Ability.  
381.  Reﬂexive  Triggers  use  the  Chain.  
381.1.  A  new  ability  is  created  and  added  to  the  chain  as  a  Pending  Item .  See  rule  386.  Playing  or  Activating  Abilities  for  more  information.  
381.2.  If  a  Reﬂexive  Trigger  creates  more  than  one  Pending  Item  it  creates  them  all  in  order,  but  does  not  go  beyond  the  ﬁrst  step  of  adding  them  to  the  Chain.   See  rule  386.  Playing  or  Activating  Abilities  for  more  information.  
382.  Delayed  Abilities  
383.  Delayed  Abilities  are  a  type  of  Ability  whose  trigger  Condition  identiﬁes  a  speciﬁc  time  during  a  turn  or  a  speciﬁc  event  that  can  occur  during  a  speciﬁc  timeframe.  
383.1.  Delayed  Abilities  can  be  any  other  type  of  Ability ,  and  contain  all  of  the  properties  of  that  type  in  addition  to  the  properties  of  Delayed  Abilities.  
383.2.  Delayed  Triggers  are  Triggered  Abilities  that  can  be  recognized  by  describing  a  speciﬁc  time  of  the  turn,  or  by  structuring  a  Triggered  Ability  with  a  speciﬁc  frame  of  time  as  a  restriction.  
383.3.  Delayed  Replacements  are  Replacement  Effects  that  can  be  recognized  by  specifying  the  effect  they  are  replacing  at  a  speciﬁc  time,  or  “the  [Nth]  time”  in  the  description  of  the  effect  as  it  resolves.  
383.4.  Delayed  Passive  Abilities  are  Passive  Abilities  that  are  applicable  only  during  a  speciﬁed  window  of  time.  The  time  that  the  Delayed  Passive  Ability  applies  will  be  recognized  in  the  effect  that  initiates  it.  
384.  Delayed  Abilities  will  resolve  or  be  active  just  like  the  ability  they  augment,  but  only  during  the  speciﬁed  time  in  the  effect  that  created  the  Delayed  Ability.   Example:  Ravenborn  Tome  reads  “The  next  spell  you  play  this  turn  deals  1  Bonus  Damage”  is  a  Delayed  Passive  Ability  that  passively  adds  1  damage  to  just  the  next  spell  played.  The  next  spell  is  a  speciﬁc  time,  and  the  1  Bonus  Damage  is  a  passive  ability.    Example:  Noxian  Guillotine  reads  “Choose  a  unit.  Kill  it  the  next  time  it  takes  damage  this  turn.”  When  the  chosen  unit  takes  damage  is  the  speciﬁed  time,  and  killing  it  is  the  condition  for  a  Delayed  Triggered  Ability.  
385.  Delayed  Abilities  are  not  associated  with  Units  or  Gear;  they  are  created  by  other  Abilities  or  Spells .  As  such  they  are  executed  when  their  condition  and/or  speciﬁed  time  occurs  regardless  of  whether  the  source  of  the  Delayed  Ability  is  still  on  the  board  or  not.

386.  Playing  or  Activating  Abilities  
387.  Playing  or  activating  Abilities  follows  the  same  steps  of  playing  cards.  
388.  Abilities  when  added  to  the  Chain  become  Pending  Items  until  they  complete  the  steps  of  Playing.  
388.1.  When  an  Ability  ﬁnishes  the  steps  of  playing  it  becomes  a  Chain  Item  just  like  a  Spell.  
388.2.  When  an  Ability  with  the  [Add]  action  is  ﬁnalized  it  resolves  immediately  instead  of  becoming  a  Chain  Item ,  like  a  Unit  or  Gear.  
389.  1.  Activate  or  trigger  the  Ability  
389.1.  Add  a  Pending  Item  to  the  chain  representing  the  Ability  that  is  either  being  Activated  or  Triggered.  Notably,  although  this  Chain  Item  will  not  have  a  card  representing  it,  this  will  create  a  Closed  State.   See  rule  346.  Playing  Cards  for  more  information.  
389.2.  If  there  is  currently  a  game  effect  being  resolved,  continue  resolving  the  game  effect  instead  of  continuing  the  following  steps.  
390.  2.  Make  relevant  choices  
390.1.  Make  all  choices  required  for  this  ability,  such  as  targets,  options,  or  other  relevant  decisions.   See  rule  346.  Playing  Cards  for  more  information  
390.2.  If  legal  options  are  not  available  for  an  Activated  Ability,  it  is  not  legal  to  activate  it.  
390.3.  If  there  are  not  enough  options  to  make  legal  choices  for  a  Triggered  Ability  that  has  been  put  on  the  chain,  remove  it  from  the  Chain  now.  It  ceases  to  be  a  Pending  Item  but  never  becomes  a  Chain  Item.  
390.3.a.  This  is  not  an  Ability  being  countered.  
390.3.b.  If  there  are  legal  options  to  choose,  the  ability’s  controller  must  choose  them.  They  may  not  decline  this  stage  of  playing  a  Trigger.  
391.  3.  Determine  Total  Cost  
391.1.  Determine  the  base  cost  of  the  Ability.  
391.1.a.  Activated  Abilities  will  have  a  cost  listed  before  the  “:”  in  their  text.  
391.1.b.  Triggered  Abilities  will  typically  not  have  a  base  cost  associated  with  them  when  placed  on  the  chain  due  to  their  conditions.  
391.2.  Apply  cost  increases  and  decreases  as  a  result  of  choices  made  in  the  prior  step.   See  rule  346.  Playing  Cards  for  more  information.  
391.3.  Apply  any  other  cost  increases  or  decreases  as  necessary.   See  rule  346.  Playing  Cards  for  more  information.  
392.  4.  Pay  Costs  
392.1.  Pay  costs  as  determined  in  the  prior  step.   See  rule  346.  Playing  Cards  for  more  information.  
392.2.  At  this  stage,  players  may  decline  to  pay  for  Triggered  Abilities  that  have  incurred  a  cost.  If  they  do,  the  ability  will  cease  being  a  Pending  Item  and  be  removed  from  the  Chain.  It  never  becomes  a  Chain  Item.  
392.2.a.  This  is  not  an  Ability  being  countered.

## Page 45

393.  5.  Check  Legality  
393.1.  Ensure  that  the  Ability’s  targets  are  still  legal.  
393.2.  Ensure  that  the  Ability ’s  effect  would  not  create  an  illegal  state.  If  it  would,  resolve  in  the  same  way  you  would  resolve  a  Card  that  creates  an  illegal  state.  See  rule  346.  Playing  Cards  for  more  information.  
394.  6.  Proceed  with  Play  
394.1.  This  Ability  is  no  longer  Pending.  
394.2.  This  Ability  becomes  a  Chain  Item.  
394.3.  If  there  are  other  Pending  Items  on  the  Chain,  their  controllers  perform  the  remaining  steps  of  playing  now.  
394.4.  Other  players  have  an  opportunity  to  play  Reactions  before  the  resolution  of  spells.   See  rule  326.  Chains  for  more  information.  
394.5.  Otherwise,  execute  the  Ability  just  like  a  Spell ,  then  clear  the  Chain  Item  from  the  Chain.  
395.  Game  Actions  
396.  Game  Actions  are  actions  players  may  perform  at  any  given  time  during  the  game.  
397.  A  player,  unless  otherwise  speciﬁed  or  prompted,  may  only  perform  actions  on  their  turn.  
398.  There  are  two  types  of  Game  Actions:  
398.1.  Discretionary  Actions  
398.1.a.  A  Discretionary  Action  is  a  Game  Action  that  may  be  performed  at  any  time  during  a  player's  turn  during  a  Neutral  Open  State.   See  rule  307.  States  of  the  Turn  for  more  information.  
398.1.b.  A  player  may  take  any  number  of  Discretionary  Actions  available  to  them  during  their  turn.  
398.1.b.1.  As  long  as  any  conditions,  if  applicable,  are  met.  
398.1.b.2.  As  long  as  any  costs,  if  applicable,  are  paid.  
398.1.b.3.  As  long  as  it  does  not  result  in  any  forbidden  action  being  taken  or  game  state  being  created.   Example:  A  player  can't  use  the  Standard  Move  discretionary  action  to  move  a  unit  to  a  Battleﬁeld  that's  already  occupied  by  Units  controlled  by  two  other  players.  
398.2.  Limited  Actions  
398.2.a.  A  Limited  Action  is  a  game  action  that  a  spell,  ability,  or  circumstance  of  the  turn's  progression  causes  the  player  to  perform.  A  player  cannot  perform  these  actions  at-will.  
398.2.b.  These  actions  can  only  be  taken  when  a  player  is  instructed  to  do  so  as  the  execution  of  an  effect  or  during  their  speciﬁed  occasion  during  the  turn.   Example:  A  player  may  Draw  during  the  Draw  Step  of  the  Beginning  Phase  of  their  turn  or  when  instructed  to  do  so  by  a  spell  or  ability.  They  can't  choose  to

## Page 46

Draw  at  any  other  time.  
399.  Types  of  Actions  
400.  Draw  
400.1.  Drawing  a  card  takes  a  single  card  from  the  top  of  the  Main  Deck  and  adds  it  to  the  player's  Hand.  
400.2.  This  is  a  Limited  Action.  
400.2.a.  Each  player  draws  1  during  the  Draw  Step  of  their  Beginning  Phase.  
400.2.b.  The  player  may  draw  cards  when  instructed  to  do  so  by  other  game  effects.  
400.3.  This  action,  when  instructed,  is  formatted  as  "Draw  X."  
400.4.  If  a  player  attempts  to  draw  more  cards  than  are  available  in  their  Main  Deck ,  they  do  the  following:  
400.4.a.  Draw  as  many  as  possible.  
400.4.b.  Perform  a  Burn  Out.   See  rule  418.  Burn  Out  for  more  information.  
400.4.c.  Draw  the  remaining  cards  needed  to  complete  the  Draw  action.  
401.  Exhaust  
401.1.  Exhausting  is  an  action  that  marks  a  non-spell  Game  Object  as  "spent."  
401.1.a.  To  mark  it,  rotate  the  card  90  degrees  opposite  of  Readying ,  so  that  the  orientation  of  the  card  is  lengthwise  in  front  of  you.  
401.1.b.  A  Unit  that  is  already  Exhausted  cannot  be  Exhausted  again.  
401.1.c.  If  a  Unit  is  instructed  to  be  Exhausted  while  it  is  already  Exhausted ,  nothing  additional  happens.  
401.2.  "Exhausted"  is  a  state  for  Game  Objects  that  other  game  effects  and  rules  can  reference.  
401.3.  This  is  a  Limited  Action.  
401.3.a.  Most  Exhaust  actions  will  be  costs  for  Activated  Abilities  or  Discretionary  Actions.  Example:  A  unit's  Standard  Move  exhausts  the  unit  as  a  cost.  
401.4.  When  Exhausting  is  listed  as  a  Cost ,  then  the  Action  must  be  able  to  be  completed  for  the  cost  to  be  paid.   Example:  A  spell  says  "As  an  additional  cost  to  play  this,  you  may  exhaust  a  friendly  unit."  An  exhausted  friendly  unit  may  not  be  exhausted  again  as  the  additional  cost  for  the  spell,  and  the  additional  cost  has  not  been  paid.  
401.5.  In  abilities,  the  Exhaust  symbol  represents  the  cost  "Exhaust  this"  or  "Exhaust  me."  It  resembles  a  card  turning  sideways.  
402.  Ready  
402.1.  Readying  is  an  action  that  marks  a  non-spell  Game  Object  as  available  for  action.  
402.1.a.  To  mark  it,  rotate  the  card  90  degrees  opposite  of  Exhausting ,  so  that  it  is  vertically  oriented  in  front  of  you.  
402.1.b.  A  Unit  that  is  already  Ready  cannot  be  Readied  again.  
402.1.c.  If  a  Unit  is  instructed  to  be  Readied  while  it  is  already  Ready ,  nothing  additional  happens.

## Page 47

402.2.  "Ready"  is  a  state  for  Game  Objects  that  other  game  effects  and  rules  can  reference.  
402.3.  This  is  a  Limited  Action.  
402.3.a.  A  player  Readies  all  non-spell  Game  Objects  they  Control  during  the  Ready  Step  of  the  Beginning  Phase  on  their  turn.  
402.3.b.  The  player  may  also  Ready  their  Game  Objects  when  effects  or  spells  instruct  them  to  do  so.  
403.  Recycle  
403.1.  Recycling  cards  is  the  action  in  which  a  player  takes  one  or  more  cards  from  a  speciﬁc  zone  and  then  puts  it  on  the  bottom  of  the  corresponding  deck.  
403.1.a.  Main  Deck  cards  are  Recycled  to  the  Main  Deck.  
403.1.b.  Runes  are  Recycled  to  the  Rune  Deck.  
403.1.c.  Each  player  Recycles  cards  to  their  own  Main  Deck  and  Rune  Deck ,  regardless  of  which  player  is  instructed  to  perform  the  Recycle  action.  
403.2.  This  is  a  Limited  Action.  
403.2.a.  The  player  must  Recycle  cards  from  the  speciﬁed  zones  when  instructed  to  do  so  by  game  effects  or  costs.  
403.3.  When  Recycling  is  listed  as  a  Cost ,  the  action  must  be  able  to  be  completed  for  the  cost  to  be  paid.   Example:  Vi,  Destructive  has  the  ability  "Recycle  1  from  your  trash:  Give  me  +1  [M]  this  turn."  Each  time  a  player  activates  the  ability,  they  must  recycle  1  card  from  their  trash  to  pay  its  cost.  If  they  have  no  cards  in  their  trash,  they  can't  activate  the  ability,  because  they  can't  pay  its  cost.  
403.4.  When  Recycling  is  part  of  an  effect,  a  player  must  Recycle  as  many  cards  as  possible  from  the  speciﬁed  zone  or  zones.  
403.5.  If  2  or  more  cards  are  Recycled  to  the  Main  Deck  simultaneously,  they  are  placed  on  the  bottom  of  that  deck  in  a  random  order.   Example:  Garbage  Grabber  has  the  ability  "Recycle  3  from  your  trash,  [1],  [E]:  Draw  "  To  pay  the  cost  of  activating  this  ability,  its  controller  chooses  3  cards  from  their  trash  and  places  them  on  the  bottom  of  their  Main  Deck  in  a  random  order.  
403.5.a.  If  2  or  more  cards  are  Recycled  to  the  Rune  Deck  simultaneously,  they  are  placed  on  the  bottom  of  that  deck  in  the  order  of  their  owner's  choosing.  
403.6.  This  action,  when  instructed,  is  sometimes  formatted  as  " Recycle  X  from  [Zone]."  That  means  to  take  X  cards  of  the  instructed  player's  choice  from  the  relevant  zone  and  recycle  them.   Example:  Dr.  Mundo,  Expert  has  the  ability  "At  the  start  of  your  Beginning  Phase,  recycle  3  from  your  trash."  As  that  ability  resolves,  its  controller  recycles  3  cards  from  their  trash.  If  there  are  fewer  than  3  cards  in  that  player's  trash,  they  recycle  as  many  as  they  can.  
404.  Deal  
404.1.  Spells,  Units,  Abilities,  and  other  game  effects  may  Deal  Damage  to  units.  
404.1.a.  Assigning  Damage  during  Combat  Resolution  is  not  Dealing  Damage,  but  will  cause  Damage  to  be  Dealt  when  assignment  is  complete.  
404.1.b.  To  Deal  Damage  to  Units,  mark  the  speciﬁed  amount  of  Damage  on  the  Unit.  
404.1.c.  Damage  is  marked  on  each  unit  separately.

## Page 48

404.1.d.  Damage  can  be  Dealt  to  more  than  one  Unit  at  the  same  time.  
404.2.  Only  Damage  can  be  Dealt.  
404.3.  Dealing  Damage  is  a  Limited  Action.  
404.3.a.  Assigning  Damage  causes  Damage  to  be  dealt  outside  of  being  directed  to  Deal  Damage.   See  rule  437.  Combat  for  more  information.  
404.4.  Dealing  can  have  the  intrinsic  property  of  Bonus  Damage.  
404.5.  Bonus  Damage  is  a  property  granted  to  the  action  of  Dealing  and  alters  the  amount  of  Damage  distributed  by  this  action.   See  rule  712.  Bonus  Damage  for  more  information.  
404.6.  Deal  actions  can  originate  from  one  or  more  sources.  
404.6.a.  If  a  game  effect  does  not  specify  a  source,  the  game  effect  describing  the  Deal  action  is  the  source.   Example:  Void  Seeker  is  a  spell  that  reads  “Deal  4  to  a  unit  at  a  battleﬁeld.  Draw  1.”  The  damage  that  Void  Seeker  instructs  you  to  deal  is  dealt  by  Void  Seeker.  
404.6.b.  If  a  game  effect  does  specify  a  source,  then  that  source  is  what  is  considered  the  origin  of  the  Damage  for  this  Deal  action.  
404.6.b.1.  Units  and  Spells  can  be  the  source  of  Damage  for  Deal  actions.  
404.6.b.2.  Abilities  can  be  the  source  of  Damage  for  Deal  actions.  
404.6.b.2.a.  When  an  Ability  is  the  source  of  Damage  for  a  Deal  action,  it  is  in  addition  to  the  Spell  or  Unit  that  created  that  Ability.   Example:  Iron  Ballista  is  a  gear  that  says  “[E]:  Deal  2  to  a  unit  at  a  battleﬁeld.”  This  damage  is  dealt  both  by  a  gear  and  by  an  ability.  
404.6.b.3.  When  a  spell  or  ability  speciﬁes  a  Unit  as  the  source  of  the  Damage  for  the  Deal  action,  it  is  not  in  addition  to  the  spell  or  ability  that  speciﬁed  it.   Example:  Challenge  is  a  spell  that  reads  “Choose  a  friendly  unit  and  an  enemy  unit.  They  deal  damage  equal  to  their  Mights  to  each  other.”  The  damage  that  Challenge  causes  to  be  dealt  is  dealt  by  the  chosen  units,  not  by  Challenge.  
404.6.c.  Damage  Dealt  as  a  result  of  being  assigned  during  Combat  has  the  Units  as  its  source.  
404.6.c.1.  The  Damage  assigned,  and  subsequently  Dealt ,  to  attackers  has  the  defenders  as  the  source  and  vice  versa.  
404.7.  Deal  actions  can  distribute  Damage  as  part  of  combat  actions  or  non-combat  actions.  
405.  Heal  
405.1.  Damage  being  cleared  from  Units  is  Healing.  
405.1.a.  If  Damage  is  cleared  for  any  reason  it  is  considered  Healing.  
405.2.  More  than  one  Unit  can  be  Healed  at  the  same  time.  
405.3.  Healing  is  a  Limited  Action.  
405.3.a.  Players  may  only  Heal  units  when  game  effects  instruct  them  to,  or  at  speciﬁc  points  in  the  turn.  
406.  Play

## Page 49

406.1.  A  player  Plays  cards  by  paying  costs  associated  with  that  card.   See  rule  346.  Playing  Cards  for  more  information.  
406.2.  This  is  a  Discretionary  Action.  
406.2.a.  As  long  as  a  player  has  the  resources  to  pay  the  costs  associated  with  the  card,  they  may  play  cards.  
406.3.  Game  effects  may  result  in  cards  being  played  as  part  of  their  resolution.  
406.3.a.  This  treats  Play  as  a  Limited  Action.  
406.3.b.  Treat  all  steps  of  Play  as  normal,  except  as  noted  by  the  game  effect  creating  this  Limited  Play  Effect.  
406.3.c.  If  there  are  no  eligible  cards  to  Play  when  instructed  to  Play  in  this  manner  like  this,  then  nothing  happens  and  resolution  continues.  
406.4.  Some  Abilities  trigger  when  cards  are  played  or  otherwise  check  whether  cards  have  been  played.  
406.4.a.  These  abilities  trigger  when  the  act  of  playing  the  card  has  been  completed  by  the  resolution  of  the  card.  
406.4.b.  If  a  game  effect  prevents  the  resolution  of  the  card—for  example,  because  the  card  was  countered —the  card  wasn't  played  and  no  abilities  that  trigger  on  playing  cards  trigger.   See  rule  412.  Counter  for  more  information.  
407.  Move

407.3.  The  Standard  Move  inherent  to  Units  is  a  Discretionary  Action.  
407.3.a.  The  Cost  is  Exhausting  one  or  more  Units.  
407.3.b.  The  Effect  is  Moving  those  Unit.  
408.  Hide  
408.1.  Hiding  a  card  is  the  act  of  placing  a  card  facedown  at  a  Battleﬁeld  you  control.  
408.2.  Hiding  is  a  Discretionary  Action.  
408.2.a.  The  Hidden  keyword  allows  a  player  to  pay  a  cost  to  Hide  a  card  any  time  they  have  a  Hidden  card  in  their  hand  or  Champion  Zone  and  meet  the  prerequisites.   See  rule  737.  Hidden  for  more  information.  
408.3.  Cards  that  are  facedown  at  Battleﬁelds  have  their  gameplay  properties  and  permissions  deﬁned  by  the  effect  that  put  them  there.   Example:  Cards  that  players  Hide  with  the  Hidden  keyword  can  be  Played  for  [0]  on  any  subsequent  turn  as  a  property  of  the  Hidden  keyword.  
408.4.  If  a  facedown  card  would  be  put  into  a  zone  whose  Privacy  is  Private  or  Secret ,  or  if  the  game  ends,  its  owner  reveals  it  to  all  players.

409.  Discard  
409.1.  Discarding  a  card  is  moving  it  from  a  player's  hand  directly  into  their  trash  without  activating  or  executing  its  normal  rules  text.  
409.1.a.  The  player  who  is  performing  the  action  chooses  which  cards  to  send  to  their  Trash ,  and  may  use  Private  Information  to  do  so.  
409.1.b.  “When  I  am  discarded”  abilities  or  other  Triggered  Abilities  that  trigger  on  discarding  are  executed  after  discarding  has  occurred.  
409.2.  Discarding  is  a  Limited  Action.  
409.2.a.  A  player  must  Discard  cards  when  instructed  to  do  so  by  game  effects  or  costs.  
409.3.  When  Discarding  is  listed  as  a  Cost ,  then  the  Action  must  be  able  to  be  completed  for  the  cost  to  be  paid.   Example:  A  card  has  the  ability  "Discard  2:  Deal  2  damage  to  a  unit  at  a  battleﬁeld."  To  activate  the  ability,  the  card's  controller  must  have  at  least  2  cards  in  hand  and  must  be  able  to  discard  them.  
409.4.  When  Discarding  is  part  of  an  effect,  then  a  player  must  Discard  as  many  cards  as  possible  from  their  hand.  If  instructed  to  discard  more  cards  than  they  have  in  their  hand,  further  discard  instructions  are  ignored.   Example:  Undercover  Agent  has  the  ability  "[Deathknell]  —  Discard  2,  then  draw  2.  (When  I  die,  get  the  effect.)"  If  Undercover  Agent's  controller  has  2  or  more  cards  in  hand,  they  must  discard  2.  If  they  have  1  card  in  hand,  they  discard  1,  and  the  rest  of  the  discard  instruction  is  ignored.  If  they  have  no  cards  in  hand,  the  entire  discard  instruction  is  ignored.  Regardless  of  how  many  cards  they  discard,  they  then  draw  2.  
409.5.  This  action  is  formatted  as  "Discard  X."  
410.  Stun  
410.1.  Stunning  is  the  act  of  selecting  one  or  more  Units  on  the  Board  and  rendering  them  Stunned.  
410.1.a.  Stunned  is  a  binary  state.  A  Unit  is  Stunned  or  it  isn't.  
410.1.a.1.  A  Stunned  Unit  can  not  be  Stunned  again.   Example:  Eclipse  Herald  has  the  ability  "When  you  stun  an  enemy  unit,  ready  me  and  give  me  +1  [M]  this  turn."  Its  controller  plays  a  spell  that  reads  "Stun  a  unit."  They  may  choose  a  unit  that's  already  stunned,  but  if  they  do,  Eclipse  Herald  will  not  trigger.  
410.1.a.2.  Stunned  Units  lose  the  Stunned  status  at  the  beginning  of  the  next  Ending  Step.  
410.1.b.  A  Stunned  Unit  does  not  contribute  its  might  to  damage  in  combat.  
410.1.c.  A  Stunned  Unit  must  still  have  damage  applied  to  it  equal  to,  or  greater  than,  its  full  might  value  to  be  killed.  
410.2.  Stunning  is  a  Limited  Action.  
410.2.a.  Players  may  only  Stun  Units  when  directed  to  by  Game  Effects.  
411.  Reveal  
411.1.  Revealing  is  the  act  of  presenting  a  card  to  all  players  from  a  zone  that  one  or  more  players  do  not  have  access  to  the  information  of.

## Page 51

411.1.a.  Revealed  is  a  temporary  state  and  is  not  a  zone.  
411.1.a.1.  Other  cards,  including  the  card  being  revealed,  can  reference  the  act  of  being  Revealed.  
411.1.a.2.  Cards  remain  in  the  zone  they  are  being  Revealed  from.  Example:  If  a  card  is  being  Revealed  from  the  top  of  a  player's  Main  Deck ,  it  is  still  the  top  card  of  that  player's  Main  Deck.  
411.1.b.  Unless  otherwise  described,  Revealed  cards  do  nothing  else  beyond  become  temporarily  known  information  to  all  players.  
411.2.  Revealing  is  a  Limited  Action.  
411.2.a.  Players  may  only  Reveal  cards  from  Private  or  Secret  zones  when  instructed  to  do  so  by  Game  Effects.  
411.2.b.  During  the  course  of  a  game  of  Riftbound ,  a  player  may  choose  to  show  Private  information  to  one  or  more  other  players.  This  does  not  count  as  revealing  and  does  not  trigger  any  effects  that  trigger  when  cards  are  revealed.  
411.3.  This  action  is  formatted  as  "Reveal  cards  from  [zone]."   Example:  "Reveal  2  cards  from  the  top  of  your  Main  Deck"  would  be  executed  by  taking  the  two  cards  from  the  top  of  your  Main  Deck,  and  then  presenting  them  to  all  players  to  clearly  read  and  understand  at  the  table.  Then,  when  all  players  have  had  a  chance  to  understand  the  revealed  information,  return  them  to  the  top  of  the  deck  in  the  same  order.  
411.4.  Game  Effects  can  manipulate  or  modify  the  cards  Revealed  while  they  are  Revealed  
411.4.a.  While  cards  are  Revealed ,  those  cards  can  be  further  manipulated,  or  accessed.  They  can  even  have  their  destination  modiﬁed  for  when  the  Reveal  ends.   Example:  "Reveal  2  cards  from  the  top  of  your  Main  Deck.  Put  one  into  your  hand  and  Recycle  the  other"  would  be  executed  by  taking  the  top  two  cards  from  your  Main  Deck  to  the  table,  and  once  every  player  present  has  had  a  chance  to  understand  them  you  would  make  the  selection  of  one  of  them  to  add  to  your  hand.  The  one  you  did  not  select  would  then  be  Recycled  to  the  bottom  of  the  Main  Deck.  
412.  Counter  
412.1.  Countering  is  the  act  of  negating  the  execution,  activation,  or  otherwise  playing  of  a  card  by  a  player.  
412.1.a.  A  card  that  is  Countered  does  nothing  and  is  then  placed  in  the  Trash.  
412.1.b.  A  card  that  is  Countered  is  not  considered  to  have  been  played.  
412.1.c.  Countering  does  not  refund  any  costs  paid  to  play  a  card.  
412.1.c.1.  This  includes  additional  costs.  
412.2.  Countering  is  a  Limited  Action.  
412.2.a.  Players  may  only  Counter  cards  when  directed  to  by  Game  Effects.  
412.3.  This  action  is  formatted  as  " Counter  [a  card  or  ability  on  the  chain]."  
413.  Buff  
413.1.  Bufﬁng  is  the  action  of  placing  a  Buff  counter  on  a  Unit .   See  rule  701.  Buffs  for  more  information.  
413.1.a.  A  Buff  is  also  an  object.

## Page 52

413.1.b.  To  Buff  a  unit,  place  a  Buff  Counter  on  it  if  it  does  not  have  one  already  
413.1.b.1.  If  the  unit  already  has  a  Buff  Counter  on  it,  it  does  not  get  another  one.  
413.1.c.  Units  with  Buff  Counters  can  still  be  chosen  for  actions  that  Buff  units,  but  will  not  be  Buffed  as  part  of  the  execution.   Example:  A  spell  reads  "Buff  a  unit.  Then,  if  it  was  buffed  this  way,  draw  a  card."  It  will  place  a  buff  counter  on  a  unit  that  has  no  buff  counter,  and  then  its  controller  will  draw  a  card.  However,  if  the  player  chooses  a  unit  with  a  buff  counter  on  it  already,  then  the  card  will  not  be  drawn.  
413.2.  Bufﬁng  is  a  Limited  Action.  
413.2.a.  Players  may  only  Buff  units  when  Game  Effects  direct  them  to  do  so.  
413.3.  This  action  is  formatted  as  " Buff  [one  or  more  units]."   e.g.,  "Buff  a  unit."   e.g.,  "Buff  a  friendly  unit."   e.g.,  "Buff  two  friendly  units  at  the  same  battleﬁeld."  
414.  Banish  
414.1.  Banishing  is  the  action  of  placing  a  card  from  any  zone  to  Banishment.   See  107.5.  Banishment  for  more  information.  
414.2.  When  a  card  is  Banished  it  is  placed  directly  into  the  Banishment  zone  from  its  origin.  
414.2.a.  Banish  is  not  a  subset  of  Kill.  
414.2.b.  Banish  is  not  a  subset  of  Discard.  
414.3.  Cards  and  effects  can  refer  to  cards  that  were  banished  by  the  same  object.  
414.3.a.  Separate  instances  of  an  object  or  effect  banishing  cards  do  not  reference  other  banished  cards  by  objects  of  the  same  name  or  effects  originating  from  cards  of  the  same  name.   Example:  A  spell  reads  "Banish  the  top  card  of  your  Main  Deck.  When  you  conquer  this  turn,  draw  it."  This  card  effect  allows  you  to  draw  the  banished  card  from  banishment  if  a  condition  is  met.  If  more  than  one  of  these  effects  is  played,  each  one  triggers  separately.  Each  card  will  be  drawn  separately.  If  the  turn  player  passes  the  turn  without  playing  the  card,  the  card  remains  in  banishment  indeﬁnitely.  If  the  same  player  plays  another  copy  of  the  same  spell,  banishes  another  card,  and  satisﬁes  its  condition,  they  could  play  the  new  banished  card,  but  not  the  original  banished  card.  
414.4.  Banishing  is  a  Limited  Action.  
414.4.a.  Players  may  only  Banish  cards  or  permanents  when  Game  Effects  direct  them  to  do  so.  
414.5.  This  action  is  formatted  as  "Banish  [one  or  more  permanents  or  cards]."   e.g.,  "Banish  a  card  from  your  hand."   e.g.,  "Banish  2  cards  from  your  trash."  e.g.,  "Look  at  the  top  2  cards  of  your  Main  Deck.  Draw  one  of  them  and  banish  the  other."  
415.  Kill  
415.1.  Killing  is  the  action  of  a  Permanent  going  to  the  trash  from  the  board.  
415.1.a.  This  can  be  Active  or  Passive.  
415.1.a.1.  Active  Kill  is  when  the  action  is  taken  when  instructed  by  a  game  effect  or  as  a  cost  for  a  card  or  ability.

## Page 53

415.1.a.1.a.  This  is  referred  to  as  a  Kill  Instruction.  
415.1.a.1.b.  When  a  unit  with  a  Deathknell   is  to  be  put  in  the  Trash  due  to  a  Kill  Instruction ,  it  ﬁrst  has  its  Deathknell  added  to  the  chain  as  a  Pending  Item.  Note  the  unit’s  location,  attributes,  and  other  relevant  information  to  process  its  Deathknell  when  ﬁnalized  before  completing  this  Kill  Instruction .  
415.1.a.2.  Passive  Kill  is  when  the  action  is  taken  as  a  result  of  Lethal  Damage  or  as  a  consequence  for  any  other  state.  
415.2.  When  a  permanent  is  killed  it  is  placed  directly  in  the  trash  from  its  place  of  origin.  
415.2.a.  It  is  only  considered  Killed  if  its  origin  was  any  zone  on  the  board.  
415.2.b.  This  is  not  a  subset  of  Move.  
415.3.  Killing  is  a  Limited  Action.  
415.3.a.  Players  may  only  Kill  units  when  Game  Effects  direct  them  to  do  so.  
415.4.  Killing  can  also  be  the  result  of  resolving  a  Cleanup.  
415.5.  Killing  can  be  attributed  to  one  or  more  Game  Objects.  
415.5.a.  The  Killed  Unit  or  Gear  is  said  to  be  Killed  by  that  Game  Object.  
415.5.b.  A  spell  or  ability  that  contains  a  Kill  instruction  is  responsible  for  Killing  the  Unit  or  Gear.  
415.5.c.  When  one  or  more  Units  is  killed  due  to  a  Cleanup ,  the  spell  or  ability  that  resolved  immediately  prior  to  that  Cleanup  that  applied  damage  to  the  Unit  or  Units  is  responsible  for  that  Kill  action.  
415.5.d.  Abilities  originating  from  Game  Objects  that  are  responsible  for  Kill  Actions  are  responsible  in  addition  to  the  Game  Object  that  created  them.   Example:  Falling  Star  is  a  spell  that  says  “Do  this  twice:  Deal  3  to  a  unit.”  Immortal  Phoenix  is  a  unit  that  says  “When  you  kill  a  unit  with  a  spell,  you  may  pay  [1][C]  to  play  me  from  your  trash.”  A  player  plays  Falling  Star  while  Immortal  Phoenix  is  in  their  trash.  The  “do  this”  phrasing  on  Falling  Star  means  that  it  has  a  reﬂexive  triggered  ability,  which  places  two  triggered  abilities  on  the  chain.  As  each  of  those  triggered  abilities  resolve,  it  deals  damage  to  the  unit  chosen  for  that  ability.  If  one  of  these  abilities  deals  lethal  damage  to  a  unit,  both  Falling  Star  and  its  ability  are  considered  sources  of  the  damage,  and  so  both  Falling  Star  and  its  ability  are  responsible  for  killing  the  unit.  This  means  that  Falling  Star’s  controller  killed  a  unit  with  a  spell,  so  Immortal  Phoenix’s  ability  will  trigger.  
415.6.  This  action  is  formatted  as  "Kill  [one  or  more  permanents]."   e.g.,  "Kill  an  enemy  unit."   e.g.,  "Kill  this,  [2]:  Draw  1."   e.g.,  "Kill  all  gear."  
416.  Add  
416.1.  Adding  is  the  action  of  putting  resources  into  a  player's  Rune  Pool.  
416.2.  Spells,  triggered  abilities,  and  activated  abilities  that  Add  resources  ﬁnalize  immediately.  
416.2.a.  Priority  and  Focus  will  not  pass  from  Add  abilities  being  ﬁnalized,  and  will  resolve  before  any  other  outstanding  items  on  the  chain  are  ﬁnalized.

## Page 54

416.3.  Activated  abilities  that  Add  resources  and  have  the  Reaction  tag  can  be  activated  during  the  playing  or  resolution  of  other  spells  and  abilities,  any  time  that  those  spells  or  abilities  require  that  resources  be  paid.   Example:  A  player  can  add  Energy  and  Power  through  any  means  before  initiating  the  process  of  playing  a  spell.  After  initiating  that  process,  in  the  Pay  Costs  step,  they  may  activate  Add  Reactions  to  add  Energy  or  Power  to  pay  costs.  
416.4.  Adding  is  a  Limited  Action.  
416.4.a.  Players  may  only  Add  resources  when  Game  Effects  direct  them  to  do  so.  
416.5.  This  action  is  formatted  as  "Add  [one  or  more  resources]."   e.g.,  "Add  [2]."  means  "Add  2  Energy."   e.g.,  "[E]:  Add  [Y]."  means  "Add  1  Power  of  the  Order  domain."   e.g.,  "Add  [1][G]."  means  "Add  1  Energy  and  1  Power  of  the  Calm  domain."  
417.  Channel  
417.1.  Channeling  is  the  action  of  taking  one  or  more  Runes  from  the  top  of  a  player's  Rune  Deck  and  putting  them  on  the  board.  
417.2.  The  Game  Effect  that  instructs  a  player  to  channel  1  or  more  runes  may  specify  the  conditions  or  circumstances  under  which  those  runes  enter  the  board.  Example:  A  spell  reads  "Channel  1  rune  exhausted."  As  that  spell  resolves,  its  controller  puts  the  top  rune  of  their  rune  deck  onto  the  board  and  that  rune  enters  the  board  exhausted  rather  than  ready.  
417.3.  Channeling  is  a  Limited  Action.  
417.3.a.  Players  may  only  channel  runes  when  Game  Effects  direct  them  to  do  so.  
417.4.  This  action  is  formatted  as  "Channel  X  rune(s),"  optionally  followed  by  conditions  or  stipulations.   e.g.,  "Channel  1  rune."   e.g.,  "When  you  play  me,  channel  1  rune  exhausted."   e.g.,  "Channel  2  runes  exhausted.  If  you  couldn't  channel  2  runes  this  way,  draw  1."  
418.  Burn  Out  
418.1.  Burning  Out  is  an  action  a  player  must  perform  if  they  attempt  to  move  one  or  more  cards  from  their  Main  Deck  to  any  other  zone  in  excess  of  the  number  of  cards  remaining  in  their  Main  Deck:  
418.1.a.  If  a  player  must  Draw  cards  in  excess  to  the  number  of  cards  in  their  deck,  they  will  Draw  as  many  as  possible,  perform  this  action,  then  Draw  the  remaining  amount  instructed.  
418.1.b.  If  a  player  must  put  one  or  more  cards  from  their  Main  Deck  in  any  other  zone,  such  as  the  Trash ,  in  excess  of  the  number  of  cards  in  their  deck  they  will  do  so  as  much  as  possible,  perform  this  action,  and  then  complete  the  remaining  number  required  by  the  instruction.  
418.1.c.  If  an  instruction  directs  a  player  to  look  at  or  reveal  cards  in  excess  to  the  number  of  cards  in  a  player’s  Main  Deck ,  that  player  looks  at  or  Reveals  as  many  as  possible,  but  does  not  Burn  Out,  then  proceeds  with  the  rest  of  the  instruction.  
418.1.c.1.  If  there  are  insufﬁcient  cards  among  the  looked  at  or  revealed  cards  to  perform  subsequent  actions  to  the  revealed  or  looked  at  cards,  any  further  instructions  are  ignored.  This  does  not  cause  a  Burn  Out ,  even  if  those  instructions  would  cause  those  cards  to  change  zones.   Reminder:  Cards  are  considered  in  the  zone  of  origin  while  being  looked  at  or  revealed,  in  this  case  the  Main  Deck .  
418.2.  To  Burn  Out ,  a  player  does  the  following  in  sequence:  
418.2.a.  Performs  as  much  of  the  prescribed  action  as  possible.

## Page 55

418.2.b.  Recycles  their  trash  into  their  Main  Deck.   Reminder:  When  multiple  cards  are  Recycled  to  the  Main  Deck  at  the  same  time,  those  cards  must  be  randomized  
418.2.c.  Chooses  an  opponent  to  gain  1  point.  
418.2.d.  Completes  the  remainder  of  the  action  that  caused  them  to  burn  out.   Example:  A  player  attempts  to  draw  1  during  their  Draw  Phase  while  their  Main  Deck  is  empty.  That  player  instead  recycles  their  trash  into  their  Main  Deck,  randomizing  it  as  normal,  then  chooses  an  opponent  to  gain  1  point,  and  then  draws  1.  
418.3.  A  player's  Main  Deck  may  remain  empty  as  they  Burn  Out ,  usually  because  their  trash  is  also  empty.  When  they  attempt  to  perform  the  original  action  again,  it  will  cause  another  Burn  Out .  
418.3.a.  Unless  some  effect  intervenes,  this  will  result  in  them  burning  out  repeatedly,  giving  1  point  to  an  opponent  each  time,  until  an  opponent  passes  the  Victory  Score  and  wins  the  game.  
418.4.  Burning  Out  is  a  Limited  Action.  
418.4.a.  Players  may  only  burn  out  when  Game  Effects  direct  them  to  do  so.  
418.5.  Burning  Out  is  a  Replacement  Effect.   See  rule  364.  Replacement  Effects  for  more  information.  
419.  Double  
419.1.  Doubling  is  the  act  of  increasing   a  numeric  attribute  by  an  amount  equal  to  that  attribute’s  current  value.  
419.1.a.  This  creates  an  effect  that  modulates  that  attribute  by  that  speciﬁc  amount  for  the  duration  speciﬁed  by  the  Game  Effect  that  instructed  the  player  to  perform  this  action.  Example:  A  unit  with  3  base  Might  and  Shield  2  is  in  combat  as  a  Defender.  Since  Shield  applies,  its  current  Might  is  5.  A  player  chooses  it  as  the  target  for  Last  Stand,  a  spell  that  reads  in  part  “Double  a  friendly  unit's  Might  this  turn.”  Its  current  Might  is  5,  so  it  gets  +5  Might  this  turn,  for  a  current  Might  of  10.  After  combat,  Shield  no  longer  applies,  but  the  +5  Might  from  Last  Stand  does,  so  the  unit’s  Might  is  8.  
419.2  Doubling  is  a  Limited  Action.  
419.2.a.  Players  may  only  Double  when  Game  Effects  direct  them  to  do  so.  
420.  Swap  
420.1.  Swapping  is  the  act  of  increasing  one  numeric  value  and  decreasing  another  numeric  value  on  some  number  of  Game  Objects  such  that  their  values  are  reversed.  
420.1.a.  Swapping  creates  two  different  effects  that  apply  to  each  attribute.  One  that  Increases  one  value  and  one  that  Decreases  the  other.  
420.1.b.  To  accomplish  this,  determine  the  difference  between  these  values  and  then  apply  an  Increase  for  that  amount  to  the  lower  value   of  the  two  attributes,  and  a  Decrease  of  that  amount  to  the  higher  value  of  the  two  attributes.  
420.1.c  If  both  attributes  are  the  same  numeric  value,  Swapping  has  no  effect.  
420.2.  Swapping  is  a  Limited  Action.  
420.2.a  Players  may  only  swap  when  Game  Effects  direct  them  to  do  so.  
421.  Attach

## Page 56

421.1.  Attaching  is  the  act  of  linking  two  cards  on  the  board  together  to  combine  their  effects  in  some  way.  This  causes  one  or  more  cards  to  become  Attached  and  at  least  one  card  to  become  a  Top-Most  Card.  See  rule  716  Attachment  for  more  information.  
421.1.a.  Attaching  affects  two  cards  at  once.  
421.1.a.1.  One  card  will  be  designated  as  the  one  being  Attached ,  and  thus  become  Attached.  The  other  will  become  the  Top-Most  Card.  
421.1.b.  This  is  represented  by  physically  laying  the  Top-Most  card  on  top  of  the  other  or  others  such  that  all  Effect  Texts  and  Might  Bonuses  are  showing,  but  nothing  else  from  the  card  or  cards  Attached.  
421.1.b.1.  In  the  situation  where  there  is  more  than  one  card  attached  to  the  Top-Most  card ,  they  should  be  stacked  in  such  a  way  that  all  Effect  Text  boxes  and  Might  Bonuses  are  readable.  The  order  of  the  Attached  cards  has  no  bearing  on  the  application  of  effects.  
421.1.c.  The  Top-Most  card  has  all  Effect  Text  of  all  cards  Attached  to  it  appended  to  its  Rules  Text.  
421.1.d.  The  Top-Most  Card  has  its  Might  modulated  by  the  Might  Bonus  of  all  cards  Attached  to  it.  
421.1.e.  Attaching  one  or  more  cards  will  cause  those  cards’  Rules  Text  to  become  Inactive  for  as  long  as  they  remain  Attached.  See  rule  716  Attachment  for  more  information.  
421.1.f.  Attaching  a  card  will  cause  it  to  Detach  from  any  card  to  which  it  is  currently  Attached.  
421.2.  Attaching  is  a  Limited  Action.  
421.2.a.  Players  may  only  Attach  cards  when  directed  to  by  Game  Effects.  
421.3.  Attaching  cards  does  not  inherently  choose  or  specify  a  target.  However,  Game  Effects  that  Attach  cards  may  do  so.  
421.4.  When  a  card  Attaches  to  a  card,  its  location  becomes  the  same  as  the  new  Top-Most  Card.  
421.4.a.  This  is  not  a  Move.  
422.  Detach  
422.1.  Detaching  is  the  act  of  unlinking  two  cards  that  are  currently  linked  through  the  act  of  Attaching .  This  causes  one  to  cease  being  Attached ,  and  potentially  causes  the  other  to  cease  being  a  Top-Most  card.  
422.1.a.  Detaching  affects  only  cards  that  are  currently  Attached  to  another  card.  
422.1.a.1.  Game  effects  that  instruct  a  player  to  Detach  a  card  that  is  currently  not  Attached  to  anything  will  do  nothing.  
422.1.b.  When  one  or  more  cards  become  Detached ,  they  cease  to  be  in  the  Attached  state.  
422.1.b.1.  To  represent  this,  these  cards  should  no  longer  be  placed  under  the  card  they  were  previously  placed  under  as  Top-Most  Card.  
422.1.b.2.  If  the  Top-Most  Card  no  longer  has  any  cards  Attached  to  it  after  this,  it  is  no  longer  a  Top-Most  Card.  
422.1.c.  The  card  being  Detached  has  its  Effect  Text  become  Inactive  and  its  Rules  Text  cease  being  Inactive.

## Page 57

422.1.d.  The  Top-Most  Card  ceases  to  have  the  Effect  Text  of  the  card  being  Detached  appended  to  its  Rules  Text.  
422.1.e.  The  Top-Most  Card  ceases  to  have  its  Might  modulated  by  the  Might  Bonus  of  the  card  being  Detached.  
422.2.  Detaching  is  a  Limited  Action.  
422.2.a.  Players  may  only  Detach  cards  when  directed  to  by  Game  Effects.  
422.3.  Detaching  cards  does  not  inherently  choose,  or  specify  a  target.  However,  Game  Effects  that  Detach  cards  may.  
422.4.  When  a  card  Detaches  from  a  Top-Most  Card ,  its  location  is  the  same  as  the  Top-Most  Card  from  which  it  Detached.  
422.4.a.  If  the  Detached  card  was  a  Gear  and  this  causes  it  to  become  present  at  a  Battleﬁeld ,  it  will  be  Recalled  during  the  next  Cleanup.  
422.4.b.  If  the  Attached  card  was  Detached  because  the  Top-Most  Card  changed  zones  from  a  board  zone  to  a  non-board  zone,  then  the  location  that  the  Attached  Card  will  Detach  to  is  the  last  location  the  Top-Most  Card  was  at  before  changing  from  a  board  zone  to  a  non-board  zone.  
423.  Movement  
424.  Moving  is  a  Limited  Action.  
424.1.  A  Permanent  changing  its  position  from  any  space  on  the  Board  to  another  space  on  the  Board  is  a  Move ,  unless  it  is  caused  by  a  corrective  Recall .   See  rule  407.  Move  for  more  information.  
424.2.  A  card  changing  game  zones  does  not  in  itself  constitute  a  Move.  
424.3.  Moving  is  instantaneous.  
424.3.a.  There  is  no  state  for  Permanents  between  locations.  
424.3.b.  Permanents  are  either  at  their  Origin  before  Moving  or  their  Destination  after  Moving.  
424.3.c.  Moving  does  not  use  the  Chain ,  nor  is  it  able  to  be  Reacted  to.  
425.  Moving  is  deﬁned  by  the  Origin  and  Destination  of  the  Permanent  that  is  changing  locations.  
425.1.  The  Origin  is  where  the  Permanent  is  starting  from.  
425.2.  The  Destination  is  where  the  Permanent  is  going  to.  
425.2.a.  In  Modes  of  Play  with  more  than  two  players,  Battleﬁelds  with  Staged  Combats  or  Combats  in  Progress  are  Invalid  Destinations  for  Moves  of  all  kinds  ( Standard  Moves  or  otherwise)  by  Units  controlled  by  Players  who  don't  already  have  permanents  at  that  Battleﬁeld .  
425.2.b.  If  an  action  would  require  a  Move  that  would  cause  a  Unit  to  become  present  in  a  Location  where  it  cannot  move  for  any  reason,  such  as  a  Battleﬁeld  with  two  players  that  are  not  the  controller  of  the  Unit  performing  this  Move  action  are  in  a  Combat  or  such  a  Combat  is  Staged ,  it  instead  Recalls.  See  rule  432.  Recalls  for  more  information.  
425.3.  Units  are  the  only  Permanents  that  can  Move.

## Page 58

426.  Players  may  choose  to  move  their  Units  with  the  Standard  Move.  See  rule  142.  for  more  information  on  the  Standard  Move.  
427.  Spells ,  Abilities ,  or  other  effects  may  cause  a  Move  to  occur.  
427.1.  The  source  of  the  Move  will  provide  details  on  any  restrictions  on  legality  for  Destination.  
427.2.  Units  cannot  Move  to  a  Battleﬁeld  that  already  has  units  from  2  other  players  present  by  any  means.  
428.  The  Destination  becomes  Contested  if  it  is  a  Battleﬁeld  not  controlled  by  the  controller  of  the  Unit  or  Units  that  moved.  
429.  Units  may  cause  a  Showdown  without  a  Combat  when  they  Move.  
429.1.  A  Showdown  is  opened  when  a  Move  causes  a  Battleﬁeld  to  become  Contested  while  it  has  no  Units  present  from  any  player  other  than  those  that  just  moved.  
430.  Units  may  cause  Combat  when  they  Move.  
430.1.  A  Combat  is  triggered  when  a  Move  causes  a  Battleﬁeld  to  become  Contested  and  Units  controlled  by  opposing  players.   See  rule  437.  Combat  for  more  information.  
431.  When  a  Move  action  is  complete,  perform  a  Cleanup.  
432.  Recalls  
433.  A  Recall  is  when  a  Permanent  is  relocated  from  anywhere  to  its  Base   without  it  being  a  Move.  
434.  Recalls  are  not  Moves.  
434.1.  They  do  not  cause  Triggered  Abilities  to  trigger  that  are  triggered  by  Move  actions.  
434.2.  A  Recall  causes  a  Permanent  to  change  locations.  
434.3.  A  Recall  cannot  be  prevented  by  actions  and  Game  Effects  that  restrict  or  block  Movement.  
435.  Gear  can  be  Recalled.  
435.1.  When  an  un-attached  Gear  is  created  or  played  at  a  battleﬁeld,  or  is  at  a  battleﬁeld  for  any  other  reason,  it  is  Recalled  to  its  controller's  base  during  the  next  Cleanup.   Example:  An  Equipment  is  attached  to  a  unit  at  a  battleﬁeld,  so  the  Equipment  is  present  at  that  battleﬁeld.  If  the  unit  dies,  the  Equipment  will  be  recalled  during  the  next  cleanup.  
436.  Recalls  do  not  affect  the  state  of  the  Permanent  being  recalled.  
436.1.  Unless  otherwise  stated  by  the  source  of  the  Recall ,  Damage,  Exhausted  Status,  Buffed  Status,  and  applied  Layer  alterations  will  all  remain  unaffected  by  a  Recall .  
437.  Combat  
438.  A  Combat  occurs  when  a  Cleanup  occurs,  there  are  no  items  on  the  Chain ,  and  a  Battleﬁeld  has  Units  controlled  by  two  opposing  players.  
439.  Combat  is  considered  Staged  if  there  are  units  controlled  by  two  opposing  players  at  a  Battleﬁeld  but  the  Steps  of  Combat  have  not  been  initiated.  
439.1.  If  more  than  one  Battleﬁeld  has  Units  controlled  by  opposing  players  at  it  at  the  same  time,  the  Turn  Player  decides  which  Combat  to  resolve  ﬁrst.  
439.2.  If  Staged  Combats  stop  being  Staged  before  the  Steps  of  Combat  are  initiated,  they  are  not  resolved

## Page 59

or  executed.  
440.  Combat  can  only  occur  between  Units  controlled  by  exactly  two  players.  
440.1.  In  Modes  of  Play  with  more  than  two  players,  Battleﬁelds  with  Staged  Combats  or  Combats  in  Progress  are  Invalid  Destinations  for  Moves  of  all  kinds  ( Standard  Moves  or  otherwise)  by  Units  controlled  by  Players  who  don't  already  have  Units  at  that  Battleﬁeld.   See  rule  425.2.a.  for  more  information  on  Invalid  Destinations.  
440.2.  In  Modes  of  Play  with  more  than  two  players,  Battleﬁelds  with  Staged  Combats  or  Combats  in  Progress  are  Invalid  to  be  chosen  as  a  location  to  play  one  or  more  Units  by  a  player  not  involved  in  that  Combat  by  any  means,  
440.2.a.  If  an  effect  would  require  a  Unit  be  played  to  a  Battleﬁeld  with  a  Staged  Combat  or  a  Combat  in  Progress ,  where  the  controller  of  the  played  unit  is  not  a  participant,  instead  the  Unit  is  played  to  its  controller's  Base.  
440.2.b.  Any  subsequent  reference  to  "here"  in  the  corresponding  effect  is  reassigned  to  the  Controller's  Base ,  where  the  Unit  was  played.  Any  further  effects  that  may  be  invalidated  are  invalidated  as  if  the  effect  was  mistargeted.  See  rule  352.5.  Targeting  for  more  information  on  Mistargeting.  
440.3.  All  choices  that  would  result  in  a  Combat  occurring  between  more  than  two  players  simultaneously  are  invalid  and  ineligible  to  be  completed.  
441.  The  Steps  of  Combat  
442.  Step  1:  The  Showdown  Step  
442.1.  A  Showdown  opens  at  this  time.  
442.1.a.  Establish  who  is  Attacker  and  who  is  Defender.  
442.1.a.1.  The  Attacker  is  the  player  whose  unit(s)  applied  the  Contested  status  to  the  Battleﬁeld.  They  gain  the  Attacker  designation  now.  
442.1.a.1.a.  This  player  gains  Focus  as  this  Showdown  begins.  
442.1.a.2.  The  Defender  is  the  player  who  did  not  apply  the  Contested  status  to  the  Battleﬁeld.  They  gain  the  Defender  designation  now.  
442.1.a.3.  Units  at  the  Contested  Battleﬁeld  controlled  by  the  Attacker  gain  the  Attacker  designation  now.  
442.1.a.3.a.  If  a  Unit  controlled  by  the  Attacker  becomes  present  at  this  Battleﬁeld  after  this  moment,  it  will  gain  the  Attacker  designation  during  the  Cleanup  phase  following  the  action  that  caused  it  to  become  present  
442.1.a.4.  Units  at  the  Contested  Battleﬁeld  controlled  by  the  Defender  gain  the  Defender  designation  now.  
442.1.a.4.a.  If  a  Unit  controlled  by  the  Defender  becomes  present  at  this  Battleﬁeld  after  this  moment  it  will  gain  the  Defender  designation  during  the  Cleanup  phase  following  the  action  that  caused  it  to  become  present  
442.1.b.  Finalize  items  on  the  Initial  Chain  if  establishing  Attacker  and  Defender  has  caused  Triggered  Abilities  to  become  Pending.  
442.1.b.1.  The  Attacking  player,  who  has  Focus ,  places  Triggered  Abilities  on  the  Chain  ﬁrst,  followed  by  all  non- Defender  players  in  Turn  Order ,  followed  by  the  Defending  Player.

## Page 60

442.1.c.  The  State  Closes  if  an  Initial  Chain  was  created.  
442.1.c.1.  Otherwise  the  Showdown  continues,  with  the  State  Open  as  normal.  
442.1.d.  Players  proceed  with  any  play  on  the  Chain  as  normal.  
442.1.e.  Focus  does  not  pass  upon  closure  of  the  Initial  Chain,  if  any.  
443.  Step  2:  The  Combat  Damage  Step  
443.1.  When  the  Showdown  closes,  Attackers  and  Defenders  resolve  Combat  Damage  at  the  Battleﬁeld  that  was  attacked,  using  their  current  Might.  
443.1.a.  The  Combat  Damage  Step  only  occurs  if  both  Attacking  and  Defending  units  remain  at  the  location.  
443.1.a.1.  If  neither  Attacking  Units  nor  Defending  Units  remain  at  this  stage,  the  Combat  Damage  Step  is  skipped.  
443.1.b.  Sum  the  Might  of  all  Attacking  Units.  
443.1.c.  Sum  the  Might  of  all  Defending  Units.  
443.1.d.  Starting  with  the  Attacker ,  each  player  assigns  an  amount  of  damage  equal  to  their  summed  Might  among  the  other's  Units.  
443.1.d.1.  Assigning  Damage  is  not  Dealing  Damage.  
443.1.d.1.a.  When  all  Damage  is  assigned,  it  will  be  Dealt  simultaneously.  These  actions  are  not  synonymous.  
443.1.d.2.  Abilities  or  effects  may  inﬂuence  the  order  in  which  damage  is  assigned.  Reminder:  Lethal  Damage  is  non-zero  damage  equaling  or  exceeding  the  Might  of  a  Unit.  
443.1.d.3.  Units  must  have  lethal  damage  assigned  to  them  in  full  before  damage  is  assigned  to  a  different  Unit.   Example:  If  a  player  has  5  damage  to  distribute  among  four  3  Might  units,  they  may  not  choose  to  assign  2  damage  to  one  of  the  units  and  1  damage  to  each  of  the  remaining  3.  They  must  assign  at  least  3  damage  to  one,  and  the  remaining  2  to  another.  
443.1.d.4.  Units  cannot  have  more  damage  assigned  to  them  than  the  minimum  required  to  constitute  lethal  damage  unless  no  further  units  remain  to  have  damage  assigned  to  them.  
443.1.d.5.  A  player  must  obey  all  requirements  and  restrictions  on  damage  assignment  if  able.   Example:  A  player  is  assigning  damage  to  the  following  units:  a  unit  with  Tank  ("I  must  be  assigned  combat  damage  ﬁrst.");  Caitlyn,  Patrolling  ("I  must  be  assigned  combat  damage  last.");  and  another  unit  without  any  abilities.  That  player  must  assign  combat  damage  ﬁrst  to  the  unit  with  Tank,  then  to  the  unit  with  no  abilities,  then  to  Caitlyn.  
443.1.d.6.  If  multiple  Units  have  abilities  or  effects  that  require  a  player  to  assign  them  damage  with  the  same  priority,  that  player  may  assign  damage  to  those  units  in  any  order.   Example:  A  player  is  assigning  damage  to  the  following  units:  two  units  with  Tank  ("I  must  be  assigned  combat  damage  ﬁrst.")  and  one  unit  with  no  abilities.  That  player  chooses  one  of  the  units  with  Tank  and  assigns  combat  damage  to  it.  Then  they  must  assign  any  remaining  damage  ﬁrst  to  the  other  unit  with  Tank,  then  to  the  unit  with  no  abilities.

## Page 61

443.1.d.7.  If  a  Unit  has  one  or  more  Abilities  or  effects  applying  to  it  that  demand  it  be  assigned  damage  in  a  speciﬁc  way  that  is  exclusionary,  then  the  assigning  player  chooses  only  one  of  those  abilities  to  apply  when  assigning  damage.  Example:  Caitlyn,  Patrolling  ("I  must  be  assigned  combat  damage  last.")  has  been  given  the  Tank  ability  ("I  must  be  assigned  combat  damage  ﬁrst.").  A  player  is  assigning  damage  to  this  Caitlyn  with  Tank  and  two  units  with  no  abilities.  That  player  can’t  fulﬁll  both  of  Caitlyn’s  damage  requirements,  so  they  may  choose  to  assign  damage  to  Caitlyn  ﬁrst,  fulﬁlling  the  Tank  requirement,  or  last,  fulﬁlling  Caitlyn’s  printed  requirement.  They  can’t  choose  to  apply  damage  to  Caitlyn  in  between  the  other  two  units,  because  that  wouldn’t  fulﬁll  either  requirement.  
443.1.d.8.  If  there  is  more  than  one  unit  in  which  this  situation  applies  to,  each  unit  is  dealt  with  individually.  The  assigning  player  chooses  which  ability  or  effect  applies,  and  then  resolves  the  assignment.  If  this  creates  a  situation  where  now  more  than  one  unit  must  be  assigned  with  the  same  priority,  those  units  may  be  assigned  damage  in  any  order  as  normal  within  that  priority.    Example:  Two  copies  of  Caitlyn,  Patrolling  ("I  must  be  assigned  combat  damage  last.")  have  been  given  the  Tank  ability  ("I  must  be  assigned  combat  damage  ﬁrst.").  A  player  assigning  damage  to  these  two  Caitlyns  and  one  unit  with  no  abilities  could  choose  to  fulﬁll  both  Caitlyns’  Tank  requirements  by  assigning  them  both  damage  before  the  other  unit.  
443.1.d.9.  If  a  unit  cannot  be  dealt  damage,  then  no  amount  of  damage  can  be  considered  lethal.  Such  a  unit  is  exempt  from  any  considerations  of  mandatory  assignment.    Example:  Kayn,  Unleashed  says  “If  I  have  moved  twice  this  turn,  I  don't  take  damage.”  While  Kayn  can’t  take  damage,  it  is  ignored  for  the  purposes  of  assigning  lethal  damage  in  combat.  
443.1.e.  Deal  Damage  to  each  unit  equal  to  the  amount  assigned  to  it.  
444.  Step  3:  The  Resolution  Step  
444.1.  1.  Perform  a  Combat  Cleanup.  
444.1.a.  Invoke  a  Combat  Special  Cleanup.  
444.1.a.1.  Insert  “2c.  Heal   all  Units. ”  
444.1.a.2.  Insert  “2d.  Recall  Attackers  present  at  the  Battleﬁeld  if  Defenders  are  still  present.”   See  rule  432.  Recalls  for  more  information.  
444.1.a.3.  Insert  “2e.  Remove  Attacker  and  Defender  Designation  from  all  Units  and  Players. ”  
444.2.  2.  If  no  Showdown  or  Combat  is  staged  at  this  location,  the  player  with  Units  remaining  here  Establishes  Control .  
444.2.a.  Clear  the  Contested  Status .  
444.2.b.  This  results  in  a  Conquer  if  that  player  has  not  yet  scored  that  Battleﬁeld  this  turn.  See  rule  182.  Control  for  more  information  on  Control.   See  rule  446.1.  for  more  information  on  Conquering.  
444.2.c.  This  does  not  have  to  be  the  player  that  applied  Contested  to  the  Battleﬁeld.  
444.2.d.  If  there  are  no  Units  remaining  here  controlled  by  any  player,  the  Battleﬁeld  becomes  Uncontrolled.  
445.  Scoring  
446.  A  player  Scores  in  one  of  two  ways:

## Page 62

446.1.  Conquer:  A  player  gains  Control  of  a  Battleﬁeld  they  did  not  yet  Score  this  turn.  
446.1.a.  In  Modes  of  Play  with  teammates,  Battleﬁelds  under  the  Control  of  a  teammate  during  the  Beginning  Phase  are  also  disqualiﬁed  from  being  Scored  through  Conquer  by  any  means.  
446.1.b.  A  player  will  gain  control  of  a  Battleﬁeld  after  establishing  Control  by  applying  Contested  ﬁrst.  
446.2.  Hold:  A  player  maintains  Control  of  a  Battleﬁeld  during  their  Beginning  Phase.  
447.  A  player  may  only  Score ,  from  either  method,  once  per  Battleﬁeld  per  turn.  
448.  When  a  player  Scores ,  two  things  occur:  
448.1.  The  player  earns  up  to  one  Point ,  depending  on  their  current  score.  
448.1.a.  The  Final  Point  has  additional  restrictions.  
448.1.a.1.  Notably,  points  earned  from  sources  that  are  not  Conquer  or  Hold  are  not  beholden  to  these  restrictions.  
448.1.b.  When  a  player  tries  to  earn  a  Point  through  a  Score ,  and  their  current  Point  Total  is  1  point  from  the  Victory  Score  of  the  Mode  of  Play ,  the  following  occurs:  
448.1.b.1.  If  the  player  has  Scored  through  Hold ,  that  player  scores  the  Final  Point.  
448.1.b.2.  If  the  player  has  Scored  through  a  Conquer  and  has  Scored  every  Battleﬁeld  through  either  method  this  turn,  that  player  scores  the  Final  Point .  If  the  player  has  Scored  through  a  Conquer  and  has  not  Scored  every  Battleﬁeld  this  turn,  that  player  draws  a  card.  
448.2.  Trigger  Score  abilities  at  the  Battleﬁeld  that  Scored.  
448.2.a.  Conquer  abilities  trigger  at  a  Battleﬁeld  that  was  Conquered.  
448.2.b.  Hold  abilities  trigger  at  a  Battleﬁeld  that  was  Held.  
448.2.c.  These  will  only  trigger  when  the  Battleﬁeld  is  Scored;  I.E.  These  cannot  be  triggered  more  than  once  per  turn  for  a  player.  
449.  When  a  player  accrues  Points  equal  to  the  Victory  Score  for  their  Mode  of  Play ,  they  Win  the  Game  immediately.  
450.  Layers  
451.  Layers  are  the  mechanism  in  which  Game  Effects  alter  the  Traits,  Intrinsic  Abilities,  or  other  properties  of  Game  Objects.  
452.  Layers  are  an  organizational  structure.  
452.1.  Layers  only  serve  to  structure  the  application  and  order  that  Game  Effects  apply  to  Game  Objects  to  maintain  consistency.  
453.  The  layers  are  applied  repeatedly  until  all  effects  operating  on  objects  have  been  applied  once  and  no  changes  have  been  processed.  
453.1.  Layers  are  applied  in  sequence.  Each  effect  in  them  is  applied  as  soon  as  able,  and  only  a  single  time  across  all  sequences.  
453.2.  When  a  sequence  of  applications  completes,  recur  the  process,  and  evaluate  each  layer  again  applying  any  effects  that  may  now  be  applicable.

## Page 63

453.3.  The  removal  or  disqualiﬁcation  of  an  effect  is  separate  from  the  application  of  the  effect,  but  still  can  only  be  applied  once.   Example:  Fiora,  Victorious  has  printed  Might  4  and  says  “While  I'm  Mighty,  I  have  Deﬂect,  Ganking,  and  Shield.”  If  a  player  places  a  buff  on  Fiora,  her  Might  is  increased  in  the  Arithmetic  layer,  after  the  layer  for  Ability-Altering  Effects.  The  Ability-Altering  Effect  layer  is  then  re-checked  and  the  abilities  Deﬂect,  Ganking,  and  Shield  applied.  Since  each  effect  has  been  applied  once  and  there  are  no  other  effects  to  apply,  Fiora’s  characteristics  are  ﬁnalized  as  5  Might  with  Deﬂect,  Ganking,  and  Shield.  While  a  buffed  Fiora,  Victorious  is  in  combat  as  a  defender,  an  additional  +1  Might  will  be  applied  in  the  Arithmetic  layer,  giving  her  6  Might  and  the  3  keywords.    Example:  A  buffed  Fiora,  Victorious  is  in  combat  as  a  defender  when  her  buff  is  removed.  Reevaluating  the  layers  in  sequence,  she  no  longer  gains  Deﬂect,  Ganking,  and  Shield  during  the  Ability-Altering  Effect  layer,  so  when  the  Arithmetic  layer  is  evaluated,  neither  the  buff  (which  is  gone)  nor  Shield  (which  she  no  longer  has)  apply.  She  goes  directly  from  6  Might  with  three  keywords  to  4  Might  with  no  keywords..  
454.  Layers  are  applied  in  the  following  order:  
454.1.  1.  Trait-Altering  Effects  
454.1.a.  This  layer  deals  with  effects  that  grant,  remove,  or  replace  inherent  traits  of  Game  Objects.   Name  Super  Type  Type  Tags  Controller  Cost  Domain  
454.1.a.1.  Assignment  of  Might  is  dealt  with  in  this  layer.   Example:  A  spell  reads  "A  unit's  Might  becomes  4  this  turn."  The  unit's  Might  is  set  to  4  in  this  layer.  
454.1.b.  One  Game  Object  becoming  a  copy  of  another.  
454.1.b.1.  All  Traits,  including  the  Rules  Text,  replace  or  are  added  to  those  of  the  original  Game  Object  as  speciﬁed  by  the  Game  Effect  directing  the  Copy.  This  is  applied  in  this  layer.  
454.1.c.  Effects  for  this  layer  can  be  identiﬁed  by  the  phrase  "become(s)",  "give,"  "is,"  or  "are"  in  the  text.   Example:  A  permanent  has  the  ability  "Other  friendly  units  are  Yordles."  Other  friendly  units  gain  the  Yordle  tag  in  this  layer.  
454.2.  2.  Ability-Altering  Effects  
454.2.a.  This  layer  deals  with  effects  that  grant,  remove,  or  replace  the  abilities  or  rules  text  of  Game  Objects .   Keywords  Passive  Abilities  Appending  rules  text  Removing  rules  text  Duplicating  Rules  Text  from  one  Game  Object  to  another  
454.2.b.  Effects  for  this  layer  can  be  identiﬁed  by  the  phrase  "become(s),"  "give,"  "lose(s),"  "have,"  "has,"  "is,"  or  "are"  in  the  text.   Example:  A  permanent  has  the  ability  "Other  friendly  units  have  [Vision]."  Other  friendly  units  gain  the  Vision  keyword  in  this  layer.

## Page 64

454.2.c.  Abilities  of  Effect  Text  of  Attached  cards  are  appended  in  this  layer.  
454.3.  3.  Arithmetic  
454.3.a.  This  layer  deals  with  the  mathematics  of  increasing  and  decreasing  the  numeric  values  of  the  traits  of  Game  Objects.   Might  Energy  Cost  Power  Cost  
454.3.b.  When  an  arithmetic  effect  has  a  limitation  that  applies,  it  is  limited  at  the  time  of  its  application,  and  is  “remembered”  at  that  limited  level  for  the  duration  of  its  effect.  This  process  is  called  “snapshotting.”   Example:  If  an  effect  gives  a  unit  “-4  [M]  to  a  min  of  1  until  end  of  turn”  choosing  a  unit  with  2  [M],  then  the  effect  will  generate  -1  [M]  until  end  of  turn.  
454.3.c.  Might  Bonuses  of  Attached  cards  are  applied  in  this  layer.  
454.3.d.  This  layer  applies  arithmetic  in  the  following  way.  
454.3.d.1.  1.  Increases  
454.3.d.1.a.  Positive  values,  or  increases,  to  Might  are  applied  ﬁrst.  
454.3.d.1.b  If  there  is  a  restriction  or  limitation  to  this  increase,  the  limitation  is  “snapshotted”  for  the  duration  of  the  effect.  
454.3.d.2.  2.  Decreases  
454.3.d.2.a.  Negative  values,  or  decreases,  to  Might  are  applied  last.  
454.3.d.2.b.  If  there  is  a  restriction  or  limitation  to  this  decrease,  the  limitation  is  snapshotted  for  the  duration  of  the  effect.  
455.  If  more  than  one  effect  applies  to  the  same  Game  Object  in  the  Same  Layer ,  or  to  each  other  in  the  same  layer,  then  both  effects  will  apply  but  their  order  may  be  determined  by  Dependency.  
455.1.  A  Dependency  is  established  if:  
455.1.a.  Applying  one  of  the  effects  alters  the  existence  of  the  other;  or  
455.1.b.  Applying  one  of  the  effects  alters  the  number  of  objects  the  other  effect  can  inﬂuence  
455.1.c.  Applying  one  of  the  effects  alters  the  outcome  when  applying  the  other  non-  deterministically  
456.  To  determine  which  effect  Depends  on  another,  determine  which  of  the  prior  criteria  applies,  and  then  also  which  effect’s  evaluation  is  altered  by  the  sequence  of  applications.  That  effect  is  said  to  Depend  on  the  other.  
456.1.  To  resolve  a  dependency,  the  effects  within  the  same  layer  that  created  the  dependency  must  be  applied  such  that:   1.  Identify  which  effect  Depends  on  the  other  within  the  Layer.   2.  Apply  the  effect  that  is  depended  on  ﬁrst.   3.  Immediately  apply  the  effect  that  Depends  on  the  ﬁrst  effect  next.  
457.  If  more  than  one  effect  applies  in  the  same  layer  but  no  dependency  is  established,  then  Timestamp  order  is  applied  to  the  effects  within  that  layer  and  sublayer  
457.1.  When  an  effect  begins  applying,  it  establishes  a  time  for  which  it  is  compared  against  other  Game  Effects  for  purposes  of  resolving  Layered  effects  as  its  Timestamp.

## Page 65

457.1.a.  Timestamps  are  not  rote  values.  
457.1.b.  Timestamps  are  relative  comparisons  between  effects  and  when  they  began  applying  to  the  game.  
457.1.c.  Timestamps  are  not  referenced  by  Game  Effects  in  any  way.  They  are  only  used  to  ﬁnalize  layered  effects.  
457.2.  When  Rules  Text  becomes  Inactive  for  any  reason,  it  loses  its  Timestamp.  When  it  ceases  to  be  Inactive,  a  new  Timestamp  is  established.  
457.3.  Effects  are  applied  such  that  the  earliest  Timestamp  within  each  Layer  and  Sublayer  applies  ﬁrst,  followed  by  other  Effects  in  that  Layer  and  Sublayer  in  chronological  order.  
458.  Modes  of  Play  
459.  There  are  multiple  methods  of  playing  Riftbound.  
460.  A  Mode  of  Play  must  deﬁne  several  variables  for  the  game.  
460.1.  Number  of  Players :  How  many  people  are  playing  the  game.  
460.2.  Formation  of  Players :  How  the  players  are  organized  while  playing.  
460.2.a.  This  deﬁnes  if  a  player  is  alone  or  on  a  team.  
460.2.b.  This  deﬁnes  the  number  of  opponents.  
460.3.  Victory  Score:  The  point  total  a  player  or  team  must  reach  to  win.  
460.3.a.  Victory  Scores  can  be  any  positive  number.  
460.4.  Battleﬁeld  Count:  Determines  how  many  Battleﬁelds  are  in  play,  contributed  by  players,  during  play.  
460.4.a.  This  may  inﬂuence  deck  building  requirements  in  competitive  settings.  
460.4.b.  This  may  involve  utilizing  less  Battleﬁelds  than  there  are  players.  
460.5.  Setup:  Any  changes  to  initial  setup  required  for  this  mode.

466.8.  Unique  Rules  
466.8.a.  Players  may  play  spells  during  their  Teammate's  Turn.  
466.8.b.  Battleﬁelds  controlled  during  the  Beginning  Phase  of  a  player's  turn  by  that  player's  teammate  are  disqualiﬁed  from  being  scored  by  that  Team,  that  turn.  Example:  A  player  may  not  induce  their  partner  to  retreat,  and  then  conquer  a  Battleﬁeld  their  teammate  was  controlling.  
466.8.c.  Control  is  not  shared.

466.8.c.2.  Players  may  not  issue  Standard  Movement  to  their  Teammate's  Units.  
466.8.d.  Friendly  describes  controlled  Game  Objects  by  a  player  or  their  Teammate.  Example:  "When  I  am  played,  ready  a  friendly  unit "  could  target  a  player's  own  Units  or  their  teammate's  Units.  
466.8.e.  Hands  are  still  Private  Information.  
466.8.e.1.  Players  are  not  restricted  in  what  they  say  to  their  Teammate,  however.  
466.8.e.1.a.  Feel  free  to  openly  communicate,  honestly  or  cryptically.  
466.8.e.1.b.  Revealing  Cards  is  still  a  game  action  and  cannot  be  done  unless  instructed.   See  rule  411.  Reveal  for  more  information.  
466.8.f.  The  Final  Point  has  an  adjustment  to  the  criteria  when  scoring.  
466.8.f.1.  When  scoring  the  Final  Point  from  Conquer ,  a  player  must  Score  each  Battleﬁeld  in  the  same  turn,  excepting  any  that  were  occupied  by  their  ally  during  that  turn’s  Beginning  Phase .  
466.8.f.2.  No  other  changes  to  Final  Point  restrictions.  
466.8.g.  Teammates  may  not  utilize  the  same  Champion  Legend .  
466.8.h.  Teammates  may  not  utilize  the  same  Battleﬁelds .  
649.  Conceding  
650.  A  player  may  concede  at  any  time.  
651.  When  a  player  concedes,  they  are  removed  from  the  game  in  progress.  
651.1.  If  only  one  other  player  is  remaining  after  a  player  has  conceded,  the  player  remaining  Wins.  
651.2.  If  more  than  one  player  remains  after  a  concession,  follow  the  steps  for  the  Removal  of  a  Player.

## Page 69

651.3.  Removal  of  a  player  involves  them  no  longer  being  able  to  make  choices  or  otherwise  inﬂuence  the  game.  
651.4.  If  the  player  has  Teammates  due  to  the  Mode  of  Play ,  that  player’s  Teammates  also  lose  and  are  removed  from  the  game.  
652.  If  the  game  continues,  follow  these  steps  for  Removal  of  a  Player.  
652.1.  Banish  all  permanents  and  runes  they  currently  control  and  all  permanents  and  runes  they  own.  
652.2.  Remove  the  Battleﬁeld  they  contributed  to  the  game  if  it  is  in  use.  
652.2.a.  If  it  was  in  use,  replace  it  with  a  token  battleﬁeld  with  no  abilities.  
652.2.b.  Any  units  or  hidden  cards  there  do  not  move  and  are  otherwise  unaffected  by  this  process.  
652.2.c.  If  the  removed  battleﬁeld  was  applying  any  continuous  effects,  those  continuous  effects  immediately  cease,  which  may  cause  changes  in  the  characteristics  of  units  or  hidden  cards  there.   Example:  A  battleﬁeld  reads  "Units  here  have  +1  [M]."  If  that  battleﬁeld's  owner  concedes  and  the  battleﬁeld  is  removed  from  the  game  as  a  result,  units  there  immediately  cease  to  get  +1  [M].  
652.3.  Remove  all  cards  they  own  from  the  game.  
652.4.  Counter  all  spells  and  abilities  of  all  types  controlled  by  the  player  that  has  conceded.  
652.5.  Proceed  with  the  game.  
652.5.a.  Turn  
652.5.a.1.  If  the  removed  player  was  the  Turn  Player ,  play  proceeds  in  Turn  Order  to  the  next  available  player  in  order.

700.  Additional  Rules  
701.  Buffs  
702.  Buffs  are  objects  placed  on  Units.  
702.1.  Buffs  can  be  tracked  with  a  buff  reminder  card  from  a  Riftbound  booster  pack  or  with  any  spare  object  in  your  surroundings.

## Page 70

702.2.  Buffs  can  be  added  or  spent.  
702.2.a.  To  Buff  a  Unit ,  a  player  chooses  a  Unit  and  then  places  a  buff  on  it.  That  Unit  is  Buffed  for  as  long  as  the  buff  remains  on  it.  
702.2.b.  Spending  a  Buff  removes  a  single  Buff  counter  from  a  Unit .  
702.2.b.1.  A  buff  cannot  be  spent  from  a  Unit  that  does  not  have  a  buff.  
702.2.b.2.  A  player  can  only  spend  buffs  on  units  they  control.  
702.3.  There  can  only  be  one  Buff  on  a  Unit  at  a  time.  
702.3.a.  If  a  Buff  is  added,  or  instructed  to  be  added,  on  a  Unit  that  already  has  a  Buff ,  it  is  not  placed  instead.  
703.  Each  Buff  individually  contributes  +1  Might  to  a  Unit.  
704.  Buffs  are  Game  Objects  and  may  be  referenced,  counted,  or  targeted  by  other  effects  as  speciﬁed.  
705.  If  a  Unit  leaves  play,  remove  all  Buffs  from  it.  
705.1.  Champions  do  not  retain  Buffs  in  the  Champion  Zone,  even  if  they  return  there  somehow.  
706.  Mighty  
707.  Mighty  is  a  description  that  applies  to  some  units.  Other  game  effects  can  check  whether  a  unit  is  Mighty.  
708.  A  Unit  "is  Mighty"  as  long  as  its  Might  is  5  or  greater.  
709.  A  Unit  "becomes  Mighty"  at  the  moment  its  Might  changes  from  being  less  than  5  to  being  5  or  greater.   Example:  A  Unit  with  Might  4  that  gets  +1  [M]  becomes  Mighty .    Example:  A  Unit  with  Might  5  that  gets  +1  [M]  does  not  become  Mighty ,  because  it  was  already  Mighty.  
710.  Units  on  the  board  are  evaluated  according  to  their  current  Might.   Example:  A  unit  with  a  base  Might  of  3  is  targeted  by  a  spell  that  reads  "A  unit  gets  +3  [M]  this  turn."  As  that  spell  resolves,  its  Might  changes  from  3  to  6,  and  it  becomes  Mighty .  When  that  effect  expires  at  the  end  of  the  turn,  it  will  no  longer  be  Mighty.  
711.  Units  in  Non-Board  Zones  are  evaluated  according  to  their  inherent  Might.   Example:  A  unit  in  the  trash  is  Mighty  if  its  printed  Might  is  5  or  greater.  It  doesn't  matter  if  there  were  effects  raising  or  lowering  its  might  while  it  was  on  the  board.  
712.  Bonus  Damage  
713.  Bonus  Damage  is  an  intrinsic  property  that  can  be  granted  to  Deal  actions  that  inﬂuence  the  amount  of  Damage  that  the  action  is  distributing.  
714.  If  more  than  one  instance  of  Bonus  Damage  is  applied  or  granted  to  a  Deal  action,  all  instances  are  summed  and  applied  once.  
714.1.  Bonus  Damage  can  only  be  a  positive  value,  and  can  only  increase  the  amount  of  Damage  being  distributed.  
714.2.  If,  for  any  reason,  Bonus  Damage  would  be  a  negative  number,  then  no  Bonus  Damage  is  applied  to  the  action.  
715.  Bonus  Damage  applies  to  the  total  damage  Dealt  by  one  instance  of  the  action.

## Page 71

715.1.  If  the  Deal  action  has  a  single  target,  the  amount  of  Damage  to  that  target  will  be  increased  by  the  Bonus  Damage  granted  to  it.  
715.2.  If  the  Deal  action  has  multiple  targets,  the  amount  of  Damage  dealt  to  each  target  is  increased  by  Bonus  Damage  individually  and  separately.   Example:  Singularity  is  a  spell  that  says  “Deal  6  to  each  of  up  to  two  units.”  A  player  plays  Singularity  while  they  also  control  Annie,  Fiery,  a  unit  that  says  “Your  spells  and  abilities  deal  1  Bonus  Damage.”  Singularity  deals  1  Bonus  Damage  to  both  of  its  targets,  dealing  7  to  each.  
715.3.  If  the  Deal  action  Splits  damage,  then  the  Bonus  Damage  applies  to  the  amount  of  Damage  that  will  be  Split .  This  can  alter  the  number  of  targets  eligible  to  be  chosen.   Example:  Volibear,  Furious  is  a  unit  that  says  in  part  “When  I  attack,  deal  5  damage  split  among  any  number  of  enemy  units  here.”  A  player  attacks  with  Volibear,  Furious  while  they  also  control  Annie,  Fiery,  a  unit  that  says  “Your  spells  and  abilities  deal  1  Bonus  Damage.”  Volibear,  Furious  now  deals  6  damage  split  among  any  number  of  enemy  units  at  its  location,  and  can  choose  to  split  that  damage  among  up  to  6  units  rather  than  the  usual  5.  
716.  Attachment  
717.  Attaching  is  a  limited  action  that  causes  cards  to  become  linked  to  each  other  to  combine  their  effects  in  some  way.  This  causes  one  card  to  become  Attached  and  the  other  to  become  A  Top-Most  Card.  See  rule  421  Attach  for  more  information.  
718.  Attached  is  the  state  of  a  card  being  linked  to  another  card  in  this  way.  
718.1.  A  card  remains  in  this  state  until  Detached.  
718.2.  While  in  this  state,  the  card’s  Rules  Text  is  Inactive.  See  rule  720  Inactive  for  more  information.  
718.3.  While  in  this  state,  Abilities  in  the  card’s  Effect  Text  are  appended  to  the  Rules  Text  of  the  Top-Most  Card.  
718.4.  While  in  this  state,  the  card’s  Might  Bonus  modulates  the  Top-Most  Card ’s  Might  by  the  value  listed.  
718.5.  Attached  cards  still  have  all  properties  of  being  a  card  on  the  board  while  in  this  state.  
718.5.a.  Attached  cards  still  have  all  Types  and  Tags  while  Attached.  
718.5.b.  Attached  cards  still  can  be  chosen  or  targeted  by  game  effects  while  Attached.  
718.6.  Attached  cards  cannot  be  moved  separately  from  the  Top-Most  Card  they  are  Attached  to.  
718.7.  A  card  may  be  Attached  only  to  a  single  Top-Most  card  at  a  time.  
718.8.  Attached  cards  may  have  different  Controllers  from  their  Top-Most  card.   
718.8.a.  Changes  in  Control  of  the  Top-Most  card  do  not  impact  Control  of  Attached  cards  and  vice  versa.  
718.8.b.  An  Attached  card  still  appends  the  abilities  in  its  Effect  Text  to  the  Rules  Text  of  the  Top-Most  card  and  modulates  the  Top-Most  Card ’s  Might  by  its  Might  Bonus.  
719.  A  Top-Most  Card  is  a  card  that  has  one  or  more  cards  linked  to  it  through  the  process  of  Attaching.  
719.1.  The  Effect  Text  of  all  cards  Attached  to  this  card  are  appended  to  the  Rules  Text  of  this  card  for  as  long  as  they  remain  Attached.  
719.2.  This  card  ceases  being  a  Top-Most  Card  when  there  are  no  longer  any  cards  Attached  to  it.  
719.3.  A  Top-Most  Card  and  all  cards  Attached  to  it  are  at  the  same  location.

## Page 72

719.3.a.  When  the  Top-Most  Card  moves,  all  Attached  cards  move  with  it.  
719.4.  The  Exhausted  and  Ready  state  of  the  Top-Most  card  does  not  affect  nor  change  the  status  of  the  Attached  cards  and  vice  versa.  
719.5.  When  a  Top-Most  Card  changes  zones  from  a  board  zone  to  a  non-board  zone,  all  Attached  cards  Detach  from  it,  remaining  in  their  current  zones.  
719.5.a.  The  player  that  controls  the  Top-Most  Card  that  changed  zones  decides  the  order  these  cards  Detach  in,  and  thus  the  order  of  any  relevant  effects  that  occur  due  to  the  Detach  occurring.  
720.  Inactive  
721.1.  Card  text  can  occasionally  be  assigned  to  be  ignored,  disregarded,  or  otherwise  rendered  as  not  applicable  during  the  course  of  play.  This  state  is  referred  to  as  Inactive.  
721.1.a.  Text  marked  this  way  is  not  applied  at  all  while  in  this  state.  
721.1.b.  Inactive  Abilities  do  not  trigger,  do  not  apply,  and  cannot  be  activated.  Inactive  instructions  are  not  processed.  
722.  Inactive  text  is  still  present  on  cards.  
722.1.  Cards  with  Inactive  text  still  have  keywords  for  the  sake  of  Game  Effects  that  want  to  reference  or  see  if  a  card  has  a  keyword.  
722.2.  Game  Effects  that  parse  or  interpret  text  to  determine  target  eligibility  may  still  parse  Inactive  text  for  the  sake  of  eligibility.  Example:  Spinning  Axe  is  a  gear  with  [Temporary].  While  it’s  attached  and  its  rules  text  is  inactive,  its  [Temporary]  ability  doesn’t  trigger.  However,  a  spell  that  reads  “Destroy  a  gear  with  [Temporary]”  could  still  choose  and  destroy  Spinning  Axe.  
723.  Rules  Text  is  never  Inactive  by  default.  
724.  Effect  Text  is  Inactive  unless  the  card  with  the  Effect  Text  is  Attached.  
725.  Inactive  text  can  partially  cease  to  be  Inactive  under  speciﬁc  circumstances  and  exceptions.  
725.1.  If  an  Attached  card  has  a  Passive  or  Replacement  ability  that  applies  during  the  process  of  Attaching  or  a  Triggered  ability  that  triggers  off  of  Attaching ,  that  text  exists  and  can  be  processed  as  it  Attaches.  
725.2.  If  an  Attached  card  has  a  Passive  or  Replacement  ability  that  applies  during  the  process  of  Detaching  or  a  Triggered  ability  that  triggers  off  of  Detaching ,  that  text  exists  and  can  be  processed  as  it  Detaches.  
725.3.  If  an  Attached  card  has  an  Equip  ability,  the  Weaponmaster  keyword  can  reference  that  Equip  ability  and  any  abilities  that  passively  modify  that  Equip  ability.  
726.  Keywords  
727.  A  Keyword  is  a  speciﬁc  term  that  appears  on  Cards  that  acts  as  a  shorthand  for  a  speciﬁc  game  effect,  or  ability  of  any  variety.  
727.1.  A  Keyword  can  be  an  ability.  
727.2.  Keywords  can  be  identiﬁed  by  having  a  colored  highlight  behind  them.  
727.2.a.  The  color  of  the  highlight  has  no  effect  on  gameplay.

## Page 73

727.3.  Keywords  can  be  referenced  or  speciﬁed  by  other  Game  Effects.  
727.3.a.  Other  effects  may  grant  Keywords.  
727.3.a.1.  The  deﬁnition  and  rules  of  the  speciﬁc  Keyword  will  determine  the  behavior  if  a  Keyword  is  granted  while  it  is  already  present.  
727.3.a.2.  The  effect  that  granted  the  Keyword  will  specify  the  duration  for  which  it  is  granted.  
727.3.a.3.  If  an  effect  that  grants  a  Keyword  does  not  specify  a  duration,  the  duration  is  as  long  as  that  Game  Object  remains  on  the  Board  or  in  its  current  Non-Board  Zone.  
727.3.b.  Other  effects  may  remove  Keywords.  
727.3.b.1.  The  effect  that  removed  the  Keyword  will  specify  the  duration  it  is  removed.  
727.3.b.2.  If  an  effect  that  removes  a  Keyword  does  not  specify  a  duration,  the  duration  is  as  long  as  that  Game  Object  remains  on  the  Board  or  in  its  current  Non-Board  Zone.  
728.  A  card  can  have  any  number  of  Keywords.  
729.  Similar  to  other  rules  text,  execute  any  effects  of  Keywords  in  the  order  listed  when  reading  the  card  from  top  to  bottom  of  the  rules  text.

731.1.a.1.  If  the  unit  has  a  single  domain,  the  Power  portion  of  the  Accelerate  cost  can  be  paid  only  with  a  Power  that  matches  the  domain  of  the  unit.  
731.1.a.2.  If  the  unit  has  no  domain  or  more  than  one  domain,  the  Power  portion  of  the  Accelerate  cost  can  be  paid  with  [A]  (a  Power  of  any  domain).  
731.2.  Accelerate  is  an  Optional  Additional  Cost  to  be  paid  as  a  player  plays  the  unit  with  the  ability.

732.3.  Action  does  not  alter  the  function  of  any  instruction  of  the  corresponding  card  or  effect  it  is  on.  It  is  only  permission.   Example:  Playing  a  Unit  with  Action  still  has  the  inherent  restrictions  of  playing  Units  without  Action.  It  can  only  be  played  to  the  controlling  player's  base  or  a  battleﬁeld  they  control.  
732.4.  Action  is  a  referenceable  characteristic.

733.1.d.  Being  an  attacker  means  the  Unit  has  gained  the  Attacker  designation  during  Combat.   See  rule  437.  Combat  for  more  information.  
733.1.d.1.  Assault  remains  in  effect  as  long  as  the  Unit  maintains  the  Attacker  designation.

The  Power  used  to  pay  the  Deﬂect  cost  can  be  any  Domain;  it  does  not  need  to  match  the  Domain  of  the  spell  or  the  target.  
735.1.d.  It  is  an  effect  that  imposes  a  Mandatory  Additional  Cost  on  Spells  and  Abilities  that  choose  the  permanent  that  has  this  ability.   See  rule  346.  Playing  Cards  for  more  information.  
735.2.  If  a  Unit  has  Deﬂect,  or  has  been  granted  Deﬂect,  and  is  granted  Deﬂect  by  an  additional  source,  the  Deﬂect  Value  of  all  granted  Deﬂect  keywords  is  summed.

736.2.  Multiple  instances  of  Ganking  are  redundant.  
736.3.  Ganking,  and  whether  or  not  a  unit  has  Ganking,  is  a  characteristic  of  the  Unit  and  may  be  checked  or  referenced  by  other  Game  Effects.  
737.  Hidden  
737.1.  Hidden  is  a  keyword  that  acts  as  a  prerequisite  to  perform  the  Hide  Discretionary  Action.  
737.1.a.  It  is  present  on  Spells,  Units,  and  Gear.  
737.1.b.  It  is  functionally  short  for  "While  this  card  is  in  your  hand  or  in  the  Champion  Zone  on  your  turn  during  an  Open  State,  you  may  pay  [A]  to  hide  this  facedown  at  a  battleﬁeld  you  control  that  doesn't  already  have  a  facedown  card  hidden  there  for  as  long  as  you  control  that  battleﬁeld.  Beginning  on  the  next  turn,  this  gains  [Reaction]  and  you  may  play  this,  ignoring  its  base  cost."  
737.1.c.  It  allows  the  player  to  take  the  Discretionary  Action  Hide .  
737.1.c.1.  Hide  is  not  a  subset  of  Play .  
737.1.c.2.  Hiding  a  card  does  not  open  a  chain.  
737.1.c.3.  Playing  a  card  from  facedown  (or  "from  Hidden")  does  open  a  chain.  
737.1.d.  Some  choices  made  while  playing  a  card  from  Hidden  are  restricted  to  the  battleﬁeld  where  it  was  hidden.  A  card  cannot  be  played  from  Hidden  if  it  is  a  spell  with  no  valid  targets  under  these  restrictions.   See  rule  352.5.  Targeting  for  more  information.  
737.1.d.1.  A  hidden  unit  must  be  played  to  that  battleﬁeld.  
737.1.d.2.  If  a  hidden  spell  or  a  play  effect  of  a  hidden  permanent  chooses  any  targets,  those  targets  must  be  chosen  from  among  options  at  that  battleﬁeld,  unless  the  ability  explicitly  restricts  targeting  in  a  way  that  makes  this  impossible.   Example:  Blastcone  Fae  is  a  unit  with  Hidden  and  “When  you  play  me,  give  a  unit  -2  [M]  this  turn,  to  a  minimum  of  1  [M].”  Because  this  is  a  play  effect,  its  target  must  be  chosen  from  among  units  at  the  same  battleﬁeld  if  Blastcone  Fae  was  played  from  Hidden.    Example:  Tideturner  is  a  unit  with  Hidden  and  “When  you  play  me,  you  may  choose  a  unit  you  control  at  another  location.  Move  me  to  its  location  and  it  to  my  original  location.”  Because  its  play  ability  has  a  targeting

## Page 77

restriction  that  can  never  be  fulﬁlled  by  a  unit  at  its  battleﬁeld,  its  target  may  be  chosen  freely  from  among  the  available  options.  
737.1.d.3.  If  a  hidden  spell  or  a  play  effect  of  a  hidden  permanent  causes  you  to  play  a  unit,  you  must  choose  to  play  that  unit  at  that  battleﬁeld.  
737.2.  Abilities  and  instructions  of  hidden  cards  other  than  the  choices  listed  above  function  as  normal.   Example:  Stand  United  is  a  spell  that  has  Hidden  and  says  “Buff  a  friendly  unit.  Buffs  give  an  additional  +1  might  to  friendly  units  this  turn.”  If  it’s  played  from  Hidden,  the  ﬁrst  part  of  its  ability  must  choose  a  friendly  unit  at  the  same  battleﬁeld,  but  the  second  part  of  its  ability  affects  all  friendly  units  with  buffs,  no  matter  where  they  are.  
737.3.  Instead  of  being  hidden,  a  card  with  Hidden  may  be  played  for  its  cost  as  normal,  at  its  normal  timing  with  no  restrictions  on  targeting.  
737.4.  Multiple  instances  of  Hidden  are  redundant.  
737.5.  Hidden,  and  whether  or  not  a  card  has  Hidden,  is  a  characteristic  of  the  card  and  may  be  checked  or  referenced  by  other  Game  Effects.  
737.5.a.  This  is  independent  of  the  state  of  being  facedown.  
737.6.  A  card  that  is  Hidden  gains  Reaction  while  facedown,  and  may  be  played  any  time  a  card  with  Reaction  may  be  played  as  a  result.  
737.6.a.  The  property  is  granted  to  the  card  in  its  facedown  state,  and  is  not  publicly  known.

738.1.b.  It  is  formatted  as  "Legion  —  [Text]".  
738.1.c.  Starting  from  the  Keyword  to  the  end  of  the  clause,  the  entire  statement  is  the  Legion  Ability.  
738.1.c.1.  On  spells  and  on  play  effects  of  permanents,  it  is  functionally  short  for  “If  you  have  played  another  Main  Deck  card  before  this  one  already  this  turn,  apply  [Text].”  
738.1.c.2.  On  other  abilities  and  instructions,  it  is  functionally  short  for  “If  you  have  played  a  Main  Deck  card  this  turn,  apply  [Text].”  
738.1.c.3.    This  is  called  the  Legion  condition.  
738.1.c.4.  Legion's  conditional  can  apply  to  passive  abilities,  activated  abilities,  spell  instructions,  or  even  abilities  active  in  zones  outside  of  the  board.  
738.2.  All  instances  of  Legion  on  cards  a  player  controls  are  satisﬁed  by  that  player  playing  a  single  card.   Example:  One  card  has  three  different  Legion  Abilities.  The  Legion  Text  of  all  three  abilities  apply  as  long  as  one  card  has  been  played  by  the  card's  controller  earlier  in  the  same  turn.  
738.3.  Legion,  and  whether  or  not  a  card  has  Legion,  is  a  characteristic  of  the  card  and  may  be  checked  or  referenced  by  other  Game  Effects.

739.1.c.2.  On  Units:  "This  can  be  played  during  Closed  States  on  any  player's  turn."  
739.1.c.3.  On  Rune,  Legend,  or  Permanent  Abilities:  "This  can  be  activated  during  Closed  States  on  any  player's  turn."  
739.2.  The  corresponding  card  or  effect  with  this  keyword  is  not  restricted  to  Closed  States  or  Showdowns .  This  permission  is  inclusive  of  all  other  timings  and  options  available  to  the  ability  as  written,  Action's  permissions,  or  by  default.  
739.3.  Reaction  does  not  alter  the  function  of  any  instruction  of  the  Card,  Rune,  or  Effect  it  is  on.  It  is  only  Permission.  
739.3.a.  Playing  Units  with  Reaction  still  has  the  inherent  restrictions  of  playing  Units  without  Reaction.  It  can  only  be  played  to  the  controlling  player's  base  or  a  battleﬁeld  they  control.  
739.4.  Reaction  is  a  referencable  characteristic.  
739.4.a.  Whether  or  not  a  Game  Object  has  Reaction  is  a  characteristic  of  that  Game  Object  and  may  be  checked  or  referenced  by  other  Game  Effects.  
739.4.b.  Whether  or  not  a  Spell  has  Reaction  is  a  characteristic  of  that  Spell  and  may  be  checked  or  referenced  by  other  Game  Effects.

740.1.b.3.  If  X  is  omitted,  it  is  presumed  to  be  1.  
740.1.c.  It  is  functionally  short  for  "While  I  am  a  defender,  I  have  +X  [M]."  
740.1.d.  Being  a  defender  means  the  Unit  has  gained  the  Defender  designation  during  Combat.  See  rule  437.  Combat  for  more  information.  
740.1.d.1.  Shield  remains  in  effect  as  long  as  the  Unit  maintains  the  Defender  designation.  
740.2.  If  a  Unit  has  Shield,  or  has  been  granted  Shield,  and  is  granted  Shield  by  an  additional  source,  the  Shield  Value  of  all  granted  Shield  keywords  is  summed.   Example:  Stalwart  Poro  has  Shield.  It  is  chosen  as  the  target  of  Block,  which  says  "Give  a  unit  [Shield  3]  and  [Tank]  this  turn."  After  Block  resolves,  Stalwart  Poro  has  Shield  4  this  turn.

746.1.d.1.  When  the  additional  cost  is  paid,  the  effect  of  the  spell,  upon  resolution,  will  be  performed  an  additional  time.  Example:  Desert’s  Call  is  a  spell  with  [Repeat]  [2]  and  “Play  a  2  [S]  Sand  Soldier  unit  token.”  If  its  controller  pays  its  Repeat  cost  as  they  play  it,  the  card’s  instruction  to  play  a  Sand  Soldier  is  executed  twice,  as  though  the  card  says  “Play  a  2  [S]  Sand  Soldier  unit  token.  Play  a  2  [S]  Sand  Soldier  unit  token.”  
746.2.  When  a  spell’s  effect  is  performed  an  additional  time  with  Repeat ,  choices  must  be  made  at  the  usual  time  during  the  Make  Relevant  Choices  step  of  Playing  a  Card.  See  rule  346  Playing  Cards  for  more  information.  
746.2.a.  Choices  made  for  the  additional  execution  do  not  have  to  be  the  same  as  the  choices  made  for  the  initial  execution.  Example:  Rocket  Barrage  is  a  spell  with  [Repeat]  [4][C]  and  “Choose  one  —  Deal  4  to  a  unit  in  a  base.  [or]  Kill  a  gear.”  If  Rocket  Barrage’s  controller  pays  its  Repeat  cost  as  they  play  it,  they  may  choose  the  same  mode  or  a  different  one,  and  if  they  choose  the  same  mode,  may  choose  the  same  target  or  a  different  one.  If  they  choose  “Kill  a  gear”  twice  and  choose  two  different  gear,  they  must  specify  which  gear  is  the  ﬁrst  target  and  which  is  the  second.  As  the  spell  resolves,  those  two  gear  will  be  killed  in  the  chosen  order.  
746.3.  Multiple  instances  of  Repeat  can  be  paid  for  separately.  The  spell’s  instructions   will  be  executed  an  additional  time  for  each  instance  of  Repeat  that  is  paid  for.  
746.3.a.  Regardless  of  the  number  of  times  a  spell's  instructions  are  executed  with  this  keyword,  the  spell  is  only  Played  once.  
746.4.  Repeat ,  and  whether  or  not  a  spell  has  Repeat ,  is  a  characteristic  of  the  Spell  and  may  be  checked  or  referenced  by  other  Game  Effects.

747.1.c.  Weaponmaster  is  functionally  short  for:  “When  you  play  me,  choose  a  Card  you  control  with  the  Equipment  tag.  Necessary  portions  of  its  Rules  Text  are  no  longer  Inactive  if  they  are  currently  Inactive.  Pay  the  cost  of  its  Equip  ability,  reduced  by  [A],  to  attach  it  to  this  unit.”  See  rule  716  Attachment  for  more  information.

747.1.c.2.  The  cost  of  the  Equip  ability  is  determined  as  though  that  Equip  ability  was  being  activated  choosing  the  unit  with  the  Weaponmaster  ability,  as  modulated  by  any  abilities  that  alter  Equip  costs.  
747.1.c.3.  If  the  chosen  card’s  Equip  cost  does  not  contain  [A],  it  can  still  be  paid,  but  will  not  be  reduced.  
747.1.c.4.  If  the  chosen  card  doesn’t  have  an  Equip  cost,  it  can’t  be  paid.  
747.1.c.5.  If  the  chosen  card’s  Equip  cost  can’t  be  paid,  if  it  can’t  be  detached  from  its  current  Top-Most  card,  or  if  it  can’t  be  attached  to  the  unit  with  the  Weaponmaster  ability,  it  stays  in  its  current  location,  Attached  to  anything  it  was  already  Attached  to.  
747.1.c.6.  The  Equip  ability  is  not  activated  this  way,  and  the  unit  with  the  Weaponmaster  ability  is  not  chosen.  
747.2.  Multiple  instances  of  Weaponmaster  trigger  separately,  and  can  choose  different  targets.  
747.2.a.  If  you  choose  the  same  target  with  multiple  instances  of  Weaponmaster ,  each  will  resolve  separately.  
747.3.  Weaponmaster  has  no  function  while  on  the  board.  
747.4  Weaponmaster ,  and  whether  or  not  a  unit  has  Weaponmaster ,  is  a  characteristic  of  the  Unit  and  may  be  checked  or  referenced  by  other  Game  Effects.
