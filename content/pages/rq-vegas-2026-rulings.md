# Quick Rules / FAQ for Regional Qualifier Las Vegas 2026

Source: https://grentontv.github.io/Riftbound-RQ-Vegas-2026-Rulings/#rules

## Rules Clarifications

### Last Known Information

If a spell targets a unit that later becomes illegal, no information about that unit is used. Effects that rely on that target will not apply.

### Combat Winning and Losing Timing

Combat winners are determined during the cleanup step after damage and healing are applied. Deathknell abilities trigger first, followed by "win a combat" triggers.

### Repeated Spell Resolution

A repeated spell does not resolve again if it is banished during execution. Only the first legal resolution applies.

### Hidden Blade (Repeated)

If both instances of the repeated Hidden Blade are targeting the same unit, you draw two cards total. As the card resolves, the repeated effect does not have a legal target, so no additional effect occurs.

### Combat Effect Expiration

Combat effects expire before conquering and scoring. Combat bonuses do not apply during conquer triggers once they have expired.

### Soraka + Guardian Angel and Death Replacement

- Soraka in base + unit in base: unit is saved
- Soraka on battlefield + unit on battlefield: unit is not saved
- Soraka on battlefield + unit in base: unit may be saved

### Volibear, Imposing

"When an opponent moves to a battlefield" is currently treated as if it were "whenever one or more enemy units move to a battlefield."

- If you control Volibear at Battlefield A and Charm your opponent's Stalwart Poro onto Battlefield B, you will draw 1 card.
- If you control Volibear at Battlefield A, and an opponent moves two Stalwart Poros into a showdown at Battlefield B, you will draw 1 card.

### Jax, Grandmaster at Arms

If you activate Jax's second ability targeting a unit and an Equipment already attached to that unit, the equipment will detach, then reattach.

### Repeated Temptation

If two units exist at different locations, both may be targeted. If one target becomes illegal during resolution, only the remaining legal effects resolve.

### Tideturner Targeting

Tideturner's trigger is optional. The controller of Tideturner may choose to trigger it when it is played and add it to the chain. It must have a legal target to be added to the chain.

### Multiple Cost Reductions

Apply each cost reduction one at a time, in any order.

## Tournament Policy

- Rounds last 60 minutes, followed by three additional turns.
- Intentional draws and concessions are allowed.
- Players may take notes during games.

## Gameplay Situations

### Slow Play

Judges may issue penalties for Slow Play, beginning with a Warning and upgrading as needed.

### Incorrect Sequencing

Players do not lose triggers solely due to incorrect sequencing if they clearly demonstrate awareness of those triggers.

## Decks, Cards, and Logistics

- Booster packs with incorrect rarity may not be replaced unless the issue is severe.
- Dice may be used to track numeric values such as battle might.
- Players should inform judges if their deck is physically marked or distinguishable.
