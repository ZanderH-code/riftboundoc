    "question": "Q: How do I score? How are conquer and hold different?",
    "answer": "When you take control of a battlefield you didnʼt already control and which you havenʼt scored yet this turn, you score 1 point. This is called conquering.\n\nIf you control a battlefield at the start of your turn, you score 1 point. This is called holding.",

    "question": "Q: How does the last point work?",
    "answer": "In order to win the game, you need to score the last point (the 8th point in most games, 11th in 2v2). If you try to score the last point by conquering, you will only get the last point if you have already scored all of the other battlefields this turn. Otherwise, youʼll draw a card instead.\n\nSo, in an 8 point 1v1 game with two battlefields:\n\n- If you are at 6 points and conquer both battlefields, youʼll go to 7 and then to 8 and win.\n\n- If you are at 7 points and conquer both battlefields, youʼll draw a card for the first one, and then go to 8 and win.\n\n- If you are at 6 points, hold one battlefield to 7, and conquer the other to go to 8 and win.\n\nIf you are at 7 points, you can hold one to go to 8 and win. In an 8 point 4 player Free-for-All game with three battlefields:\n\n- If you are at 5 points and conquer all 3 battlefields, youʼll go to 6 then 7 then 8 and win.\n\n- If you are at 6 points and conquer all 3 battlefields, youʼll go to 7 then draw 1, then 8 and win.\n\n- If you are at 5 points, hold 1 battlefield to 6, then conquer the other two, youʼll go to 7 and then 8 and win.",

    "answer": "Every unit has the natural ability to move itself from base to battlefield, or back from battlefield to base, during your Main Phase (on your own turn, outside of a showdown). To do this, you pay the cost (exhausting the unit) and then move the unit. If a unit is exhausted, you canʼt move it using the standard move.",

    "question": "Q: Does Ganking allow a unit to move an extra time? When can I use the Ganking ability?",

If a unit has Ganking, it can also move between two battlefields. You can move units with Ganking alongside other units that are moving with the standard move, as long as the destination is legal for all units moving as a group.",

For example, if a fury/red unit normally costs [3] (or 3 energy) and you want to accelerate it, its total cost would be [4][R] (or 4 energy and 1 power of the fury/red domain).",

    "answer": "To clarify the timing of these and other effects, we’re introducing the idea of pending items on the chain. When you play a spell, or use an ability, they will be pending until you finish the steps of playing them before priority passes. When a spell or ability instructs you to play a card or play a token—or when a triggered ability has its trigger condition met—during the playing or resolution of another card or ability, you’ll perform the very first step of playing that card or using that ability by putting it on the chain, then stop. This chain item is still pending for now. You’ll then process the rest of whatever is currently happening, including putting any other pending items on the chain above it.\n\nThen, in the order the items were put on the chain, each pending item’s controller goes through the other steps of putting it on the chain: Make choices, pay costs, and evaluate legality. Only then is the pending item considered to have entered the chain. If it’s legal to play and it’s a unit or gear, it resolves immediately as usual. Once all pending items are done being fully added to the chain, play continues, and any items that remain on the chain can be reacted to. The most recent items to be placed on the chain will resolve first as usual.\n\nIf at any point during that process that player is unable to proceed with playing the pending chain item for any reason, the item is removed from the chain and, if it’s a card, is put back where it came from. This won’t happen very often—if you start the process of playing a card, you’ll almost always be able to legally finish it—but it’s a necessary failsafe to handle corner cases.",

    "answer": "Hey, you’re pretty sharp! For most cards that let you play something, it’s easy to put the card back where it came from if you can’t play it. The Harrowing would put it back in your trash, Ava Achiever would put it back in your hand, and so on. But when the card came out of a deck, which is both secret and randomized, it’s not so simple.\n\nTo provide a clear and easy answer to this question, four cards in set 1 that let you play other cards from decks are receiving errata. They’ll each banish the card before instructing a player to play it. If the card can’t be played for any reason, it just stays banished. This is a small functional change, but it’s one we feel is well worth it to avoid the fuss of getting these cards back into a deck somehow.\n\nBaited Hook\n\n[1][C], [E]: Kill a friendly unit. Look at the top 5 cards of your Main Deck. You may banish a unit from among them that has Might up to 1 more than the killed unit and play it, ignoring its cost. Then recycle the rest.\n\nBlind Fury\n\n[Action] (Play on your turn or in showdowns.) Each opponent reveals the top card of their Main Deck. Choose one and banish it, then play it, ignoring its cost. Then recycle the rest.\n\nDazzling Aurora\n\nAt the end of your turn, reveal cards from the top of your Main Deck until you reveal a unit and banish it. Play it, ignoring its cost, and recycle the rest.\n\nPromising Future\n\nEach player looks at the top 5 cards of their Main Deck, banishes one, then recycles the rest. Starting with the next player, each player plays those cards, ignoring Energy costs. (They must still pay Power costs.)",

    "question": "Q: So what exactly happens when someone plays Promising Future?",
    "answer": "Start with the player whose turn it is—probably Promising Future’s controller. That player looks at their top 5 cards, banishes one of them, and recycles the other 4. Then each other player in turn order repeats this process. Each player can see which cards the players before them have chosen. Then, starting with the next player in turn order this time, those players put the cards they chose onto the chain as pending items, with the player whose turn it is putting their item on the chain last.\n\nThen Promising Future finishes resolving, and the players finish adding their pending items to the chain in the same order they were put there, ignoring Energy costs but still paying Power costs. They must pay mandatory additional costs (like the cost of Cruel Patron), and may choose to pay optional additional costs (like Accelerate).\n\nEach card that’s a unit or gear resolves immediately, which may cause other things (such as play effects) to be added to the top of the chain as pending items. Any cards that can’t be played for any reason remain banished.\n\nOnce this process is done, any units or gear that were successfully played this way will be on the board, while spells chosen this way will all be on the chain in the same order they were put onto it. (This may result in spells that don’t have Action or Reaction being on the chain above other items, which is usually not possible. That’s fine.) Then, resolve the chain as normal.",

    "question": "Q: OK, so what about Nocturne? How does his ability work? Is it a triggered ability? Can I use it if I “reveal” him, or only if I “look at” him?",
    "answer": "Nocturne has a few problems we’d like to address.\n\n- His ability is worded like a triggered ability (“when”), but it can’t really work like one. By the time a triggered ability could go on the chain, be reacted to, and resolve, you wouldn’t be looking at Nocturne anymore.\n\n- He has the same problem that the above cards do: you’re trying to play a card from a deck (in this case, Nocturne himself), and it’s hard to put him back there if you try to play him but can’t for some reason.\n\n- He is intended to be usable any time you’re looking at the front faces of cards from the top of your deck, whether the effect in question says to “look at” them or “reveal” them. The rules will be changed to clarify that last one—they will now explain that to “reveal” means the same thing as “allow all players to look at.”\n\nNocturne is receiving errata to solve these problems and bring him in line with his intended function. This errata makes it clear that this ability is not a triggered ability, and it uses banishment as a holding zone. It also specifies that revealing and looking both count; although we are handling that part at the rules level, we also want card text to reflect it unambiguously.\n\nNocturne, Horrifying\n\n[Ganking] (I can move from battlefield to battlefield.)

You play Stacked Deck and look at the top 3 cards of your deck. Nocturne is among them. You now get to choose whether to banish him or not. If you choose to banish him, you immediately begin the process of playing him from banishment, placing him on the chain as a pending item. Then you continue resolving Stacked Deck. There are only 2 cards left of the original 3; you’ll choose one to put into your hand and recycle the other one. Then, since Stacked Deck has finished resolving, you’ll finish the steps of putting Nocturne onto the chain from banishment, paying [A] (that’s one power of any type) instead of his base cost. As usual for units, he’ll resolve immediately and enter the board exhausted. If you weren’t able to play him for any reason, he’ll just stay banished.",

    "question": "Q: Some spells and abilities require choosing units, gear, or other things for them to affect. The rules say some of these choices are made when I put the spell or ability on the chain, but it seems like some of them can’t be or shouldn’t be. How do I know the difference?",
    "answer": "Riftbound uses a set of contextual rules rather than specific words on cards to determine which choices are made as a card is played. When a spell or ability chooses something else to affect, the rules refer to those choices as “targets.” Targets must be chosen as the spell or ability is placed on the chain, and they must still meet all targeting requirements as the spell or ability resolves.\n\nThe next version of the rules will have more rigorous guidelines on which choices are targets, which we’ll summarize here. For the most part, these rules don’t change what choices are targets, they just spell it out more.\n\nAn object or player mentioned in a spell or ability is a target if all of the following are true:\n\n- something publicly visible to all players;\n\n- that you and you alone choose;\n\n- that isn’t part of a targeting restriction, cost, trigger condition, replacement effect, or an action that “must” be taken.\n\nThis explanation sounds complicated, but in general, most things that are affected by a spell or ability are targets. For a more precise breakdown of what each of those entails, see the Appendix.\n\nThere are two other choices that are not considered targets, but are made while putting something on the chain. Those are:\n\n- The location to which a unit will be played (normally either your base or a battlefield you control).\n\n- The destination or destinations for any spell or ability whose effect is moving one or more units, whether or not it mentions a destination by name.",

    "question": "Q: Are the units I choose for Fox-Fire targets? What happens if some of them gain Might as a reaction?",
    "answer": "Fox-Fire is unusual (currently unique) in that its targets’ legality is evaluated as a group rather than individually. The updated rules will explain how to handle this.\n\nAs you play Fox-Fire, you’ll choose any number of units at a single battlefield whose current total Might is 4 or less. Then, after any appropriate Reactions, Fox-Fire resolves and checks target legality again. If the units no longer meet the group targeting restriction because some of them have gained Might, you choose any number of the original targets whose Might adds up to no more than 4.\n\nHere are a few examples to illustrate. In all of them, Fox-Fire initially chooses 4 Recruits with 1 Might each, and some of those Recruits have gained Might before Fox-Fire resolves.\n\n- One Recruit gets +1 Might. You can choose either to exclude that Recruit and kill the other three (total Might 3), or exclude one other Recruit and kill the 2 Might Recruit and two 1 Might Recruits (total Might 4).\n\n- One Recruit gets +3 Might. You can choose either to exclude that Recruit and kill the other three (total Might 3), or exclude the other three and kill just that one (total Might 4).\n\n- One Recruit gets +6 Might. You must choose to exclude that Recruit, because its Might alone takes you above your total. You must kill the other three (total Might 3).\n\n- Two Recruits get +1 Might. You can either kill the two 2 Might Recruits, or one 2 Might Recruit and the two 1 Might Recruits.\n\n- All four Recruits get +1 Might. You must choose two of the Recruits to kill, and the other two will survive.\n\n- All four Recruits get +3 Might.

    "answer": "Dragon’s Rage works a little better now that move destinations are chosen at the same time as targets, but it’s still kind of strange. Accordingly, it will receive errata with a new template for “reflexive triggers”—triggered abilities within another spell or ability that create a new ability that goes on the chain separately from the original spell or ability. To show you what that looks like, here’s the updated text:\n\nDragon’s Rage\n\nMove an enemy unit. Then do this: Choose another enemy unit at its destination. They deal damage equal to their Mights to each other\n\nThat “do this” wording (or similar) tells you that what follows is a separate instruction from the original. As you start to play Dragon’s Rage, you only need to choose an enemy unit and a battlefield to move it to. Then, assuming Dragon’s Rage resolves, you’ll put a separate triggered ability on the chain, choosing another enemy unit at its destination (if one is available). That triggered ability can then be responded to separately. If there’s no enemy there, or if you didn’t actually move the unit you chose for any reason (and therefore there’s no “its destination” to reference), the trigger isn’t put on the chain at all.\n\nThis isn’t a tool we expect to use often, but it lets us make sure that cards like Dragon’s Rage offer chances for interaction and decision at points that feel appropriate.",

If they resolve, you then put each instance of their reflexive trigger on the chain separately, choosing the same or different units as you like.

    "question": "Q: Can I move my ally’s unit to my own base with Unforgiven, the Yasuo legend? Does that mean it’s mine now?",
    "answer": "No, you can’t do this. Any time you try to move something you don’t control into your base, it moves to its controller’s base instead. This is hard-coded in the rules, similar to how cards you own can ever be in your own hand, trash, or deck, even if something tries to put them in a different when. Similarly, you and your ally can never both have units at the same battlefield; the rules prevent any move that tries to make that happen.\n\nA few cards, including Unforgiven, were printed with English text that suggests misleading outcomes in these situations (but were printed correctly in Chinese). Those cards are receiving errata to clarify what they can and can’t do.\n\nThe Syren\n\n[1], [E]: Move a friendly unit at a battlefield to its base.\n\nUnforgiven\n\n[2], [E]: Move a friendly unit to or from its base.\n\nPortal Rescue\n\nBanish a friendly unit, then its owner plays it to their base, ignoring its cost.\n\nFor The Syren and Unforgiven, this is not functional errata, just a clarification. For Portal Rescue, this is a slight functional change to its interaction with cards like Possession. Previously, you could use Portal Rescue to re-play a card you took with Possession and retain control of it, but under the new wording this would give it back to its owner.\n\nAnother card, Tideturner, is receiving similar errata and another clarification (see below).",

A spell that causes a unit to die in some other way, like Stupefy on a unit that has 1 more Might than it has damage currently marked on it?",
    "answer": "This is unclear under existing rules, so the updated rules will clarify. “When you kill a unit with a spell” triggers immediately after a spell you control resolves if either of the following is true:\n\n- That spell instructs you to kill a unit during its resolution, and that unit is put into the trash this way.\n\n- A spell instructs you to deal damage to a unit during its resolution, and that unit is put into the trash during the cleanup immediately following that spell’s resolution.\n\nThis includes “direct kill” spells you control like Hidden Blade. It also includes damage spells like Void Seeker, provided they mark lethal damage on the unit that immediately causes it to die. In all cases, the unit has to actually die—if that death is replaced by a card like Unlicensed Armory, then you didn’t kill a unit with a spell.\n\nNotably, the following do not count as you killing a unit with a spell:\n\n    - You are instructed to kill a unit by a spell another player controls, even if the spell instructs you to kill\n        the unit (e.g., another player’s Cull the Weak).\n\n    - Another player is instructed to kill a unit by a spell you control (e.g., your Cull the Weak, if you don’t kill\n        any of your own units with it).\n\n    - You play a spell like Challenge that causes a unit to deal lethal damage to another unit.\n\n    - You use a spell to mark damage on a unit and the unit dies later in the turn, even if that damage later became\n        lethal damage for any reason.\n\n    - You use a spell to directly or indirectly lower the Might of a unit, causing damage it’s already taken to become\n        lethal damage. For example:\n\n            - ○ You use a spell like Stupefy to lower the Might of a unit that has already taken damage, causing that\n                damage to become lethal damage.\n\n            - You use a spell like Charm to move a unit with damage on it away from Trifarian War Camp, indirectly\n                lowering its Might and causing that damage to become lethal damage.\n\n            - You use a spell like Rebuke to return Lee Sin, Centered to its owner’s hand, indirectly lowering the\n                Might of a buffed unit at the same battlefield that has damage on it, causing that damage to become\n                lethal damage.\n\n    - You do anything else with a spell that causes a unit to die in any other way than the two methods listed above,\n        or at any time other than during or immediately after the spell’s resolution.\n\n    - You do any of the above, but the unit doesn’t actually die.",

    "question": "Q: What does this card do, and when can it do it? If I play him from Hidden during combat, does his ability trigger twice?",
    "answer": "We’re issuing a rules update that changes how Teemo and other defend and attack triggers work, and we’re issuing a minor errata for Teemo in accordance with it. We’re also clarifying what his ability does and how many targets it has. This contradicts some previous guidance we’ve given on this card, as we’ve examined what it says, what it’s intended to do, and what our rules can support.\n\nTeemo has a “when I defend” trigger. Under previous rules, attack and defend triggers happened only at the beginning of combat. Teemo’s dual trigger condition was meant to cover this—he either triggered at the beginning of combat, or he triggered when you played him into combat.\n\nTeemo, Strategist (revised text)\n\n[Hidden] (Hide now for [A] to react with later for [0].)\n\nWhen I defend, choose an enemy unit here and reveal the top 5 cards of your Main Deck. Deal 1 to that unit for each card with [Hidden] revealed this way, then recycle the revealed cards.\n\nUnder the updated rules, attack and defend triggers trigger any time a unit becomes an attacker or defender—whether that’s because combat began, because the unit was moved into combat using a spell or ability, or because the unit was played into combat somehow. (And yes, this means that a unit that starts in combat, moves out somehow, and then moves back can trigger these abilities twice. We think this is fine—moving a unit at Action speed isn’t easy to do, and doing it twice is even harder, so we don’t mind there being a substantial reward.)\n\nOne thing to note about this change that doesn’t apply to Teemo directly: Assault and Shield are not attack or defend triggers, so they’ll work the same way they did before. They apply while a unit is an attacker or defender in combat as appropriate, stop applying once the unit is no longer in combat, and start applying if it joins or rejoins combat partway through. This rules change makes the “played from [Hidden]” part of Teemo’s text redundant. And since the ability only does anything if enemy units are present, we’re issuing errata to clarify that it only triggers once as intended, whether Teemo is played into combat or was there from the start. We’re also rephrasing the ability to make it clearer that it only has one target.",

    "question": "Q: If I win on the attack and conquer, does this happen before or after I score? Before or after conquer effects?",
    "answer": "Draven’s ability will trigger and resolve before you gain your regular point for scoring the battlefield and before any conquer effects are triggered. This means that you can’t win from 6 points by conquering a battlefield with Draven without having scored all other battlefields—you’ll gain your point from Draven, then the game will see that you’re at 7 points and give you a card draw instead of a point for conquering.\nPickpocket",

    "question": "Q: Can Pickpocket kill a Gold token?",
    "answer": "Yes, but we see why you’d ask. The rules use a “NULL” system for values that aren’t available, such as the Might of a unit that’s been removed from the board. The unit is gone and the information is missing, so you can’t do any calculations or comparisons with it (not even “is it no more than 1?”).\nThat system could reasonably be applied to the costs of tokens, but we feel that results in unintuitive situations, like not being able to kill a Gold token with Pickpocket. After all, the token’s not missing; it just doesn’t have a cost because it doesn’t need one. We’ll be updating the rules to clarify that the cost of a token can be treated as 0 for all purposes.\nRumble, Hotheaded",

    "question": "Q: Can Rumble, Hotheaded choose a Mech token to recycle? If he does, where does it go?",
    "answer": "Yes, he can. This is a minor gap in the rules. Main Deck cards are recycled to the Main Deck and runes are recycled to the Rune deck, but tokens aren’t actually either of those things. We’ll be clarifying in a future rules updates that tokens “inherit” the recycle destination of their type(s), so a token that’s a unit or gear is recycled to your Main Deck just like any other gear. It then vanishes, as tokens do any time they leave the board, but it still counts as “the unit you recycled” and Rumble can check its Might.\nSvellsongur",

  {
    "question": "Q: Does Svellsongur copy text that the unit has gained from other sources, such as the Assault granted by Cleave? What about text it’s gained from other Equipment?",
    "answer": "No, Svellsongur only copies the text that’s actually printed on the unit. This is an ambiguity in the current rules, which refer to “appending” and “removing” rules text without reference to whether that text is original to the unit or not.\nThe key word here is actually copy, a system that will be fleshed out in a future rules update. For now, we’ll just tell you that copies of objects or text take on their original traits, without regard to any subsequent alterations.\nSvellsongur doesn’t grant the unit additional “copies” of the abilities of other Equipment. So putting 3 Svellsongur on the same unit will give that unit four total instances of its abilities, not eight. (Four should be plenty.)",

And do I have to choose different options?",
    "answer": "He does have the second copy of his ability in time, and it will trigger. The “one that hasn’t been chosen this turn” restriction applies separately to each instance of his ability. So you could choose the same option for both, but you’ll have to track which options you’ve used for each copy of his ability.\nCards that Reduce Might",

  {
    "question": "Q: Does this mean that units’ Might can go to 0 or below now?",
    "answer": "Units’ Might could always go to 0 or below; it was just really hard to actually make it happen. For example: If a Recruit was at Trifarian War Camp, it would have 2 Might (its 1 base Might, +1 from War Camp). If it got hit with Stupefy, Stupefy would “snapshot” at -1 Might, reducing the Recruit’s Might to 1. If the Recruit then moved away from Trifarian War Camp, it would lose the +1 Might bonus and end up at 0 Might. It’s much easier to make it happen with Spiritforged cards, though, so it’s worth reviewing the rules for units with 0 or less Might.",

    "question": "Q: Does a unit with 0 or less Might automatically die?",

They will die if they take any damage, but “0” is not a valid amount of damage, so it takes 1 damage to kill a unit with 0 or less Might. We realize that this is a little weird, but it’s important to us that cards like Frigid Touch can’t be used to actually kill units, only weaken them.",

    "question": "Q: Does a unit with negative Might contribute negative damage to my Might total in combat?",
    "answer": "No. Negative Might is treated as 0 Might for the purposes of dealing damage, but as its true value for raising it back above 0. So a unit with -3 Might would contribute 0 damage in combat, would die if it was dealt 1 or more damage, and would require +4 Might to get it back up to 1 Might.\nEzreal, Prodigy",

These will generally use both the words “additional cost” and the word “may.” Repeat and Accelerate are the two main sources of optional additional costs, but Ezreal can also offer a discount for one-off oddballs like Blast Corps Cadet.\nEzreal can’t reduce Equip costs. That’s an activation cost for an ability, so it’s neither optional nor additional. There aren’t currently any optional additional costs that apply to activating abilities.",

Deflect is a mandatory additional cost, meaning you must pay it if you want to finalize a spell or ability that chooses something with Deflect. It’s true that you can choose not to pay Deflect costs for triggered abilities by choosing not to finalize them, but that doesn’t make it an optional cost.\nHostile Takeover",

    "question": "Q: If I use Hostile Takeover to take control of my opponent’s only unit at a battlefield, will there be a showdown? Will it be a combat?",
    "answer": "You’ll start a noncombat showdown. (Hostile Takeover’s reminder text is a little misleading in this regard—you have to have some kind of showdown before you can conquer.) This ruling applies any time you have a unit at a battlefield when your opponent still controls that battlefield, but doesn’t have any units there. (Yes, that can happen. Hostile Takeover and Stormbringer are the easiest ways to do it.)\nThere’s a gap in the current rules that leaves this situation without an obvious outcome. We plan to address that gap in the next regular rules update. The issue is surprisingly complex, and we’re not 100% sure what the answer will be when we’re done.\nIn the meantime, though, we believe starting a noncombat showdown is the least disruptive way to handle this scenario. If you need really precise timing: assume that your opponent loses control of the battlefield in the same cleanup that begins the showdown, even though ordinarily control is “frozen” once the battlefield becomes contested.\nTemporal Portal",

    "question": "Q: What parts of a spell does the Repeat ability cause to be repeated? Is it the entire effect? If I use Temporal Portal to give Find Your Center Repeat and pay the cost while its cost reduction applies, does the cost reduction happen once or twice, and does the final spell cost 2 or 4?",
    "answer": "Repeat causes you to repeat execution of a spell’s “instructions,” which are the things the spell tells you to do as it resolves. (We’ll give a better definition of “instructions” and how to define them in an upcoming rules update.) And the Repeat cost of Find Your Center isn’t reduced, even when its base cost is, because anything that asks for a card’s cost finds its printed cost as the answer.\nThis means that Find Your Center’s cost reduction applies only once and the final spell costs 4—its base cost of 3, plus its Repeat cost of 3, minus its cost reduction of 2.\nCards with Weaponmaster",
