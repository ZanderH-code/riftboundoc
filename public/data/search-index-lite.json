      "text": "Riftbound: Origins Card Errata Hey Riftbounders! We're sharing a recap of all the card errata for Riftbound: Origins. If you're new to TCGs or Riftbound is your first TCG, card errata is any updates to card text Download Card Errata Hey Riftbounders! We're sharing a recap of all the card errata for Riftbound: Origins. If you're new to TCGs or Riftbound is your first TCG, card errata is any updates to card text usually for clarity and sometimes a goof like a typo. If you're a seasoned TCG player, you might be already diving into the PDF above. With Origins being our first set, it has more than its fair share of errata, most of it focused on rules clarity and consistency. We expect to issue very little \"day zero\" errata for future sets. Most of these card errata updates have already been shared through updates in our Core Rules FAQ, so there shouldn't be too many surprises in there. A few cards that were in the FAQ have received slightly different wordings than previously announced, and there are three cards in this file that weren't in the FAQ. This is also a good time to reiterate our philosophy behind card errata. Changes from printed wordings add friction to your gameplay experience, and we don't issue them lightly. And unlike a digital game, we don't issue \"patches\" for game balance reasons. Where printed card wordings created unintended gameplay, were ambiguous about their function, or didn't quite work in our updated rules, that's where we've chosen to issue errata. The majority of the errata here doesn't change how these cards work in regular gameplay situations; rather, it clarifies their function and shores it up against edge cases and rules oddities. We're heads down on the Riftbound: Origins English Launch (soonTM) and designing many sets to come, so give us some time as we work to update the Card Gallery or add another database resource to note the official language of the cards. Currently, card errata is not planned to be included on any future restocks of Riftbound: Origins or potential localizations of the cards. We'll keep you all posted if that changes though! With the recent update to Core Rules along with our Core Rules Patch Notes plus the final piece of the Trinity Force with the Card Errata, the Core Rules FAQ is now obsolete and will be retired on November 4, 2025. Now, that we have that out of the way, let's dive into the Riftbound: Origins Card Errata: Ava Achiever [NEW TEXT] When I attack, you may pay [C] to play a card with [Hidden] from your hand, ignoring its cost.

      "text": "Riftbound Origins FAQ Scoring Q: How do I score? How are conquer and hold different? When you take control of a battlefield you didn't already control and which you haven't scored yet this turn, you sco Scoring Q: How do I score? How are conquer and hold different? When you take control of a battlefield you didn't already control and which you haven't scored yet this turn, you score 1 point. This is called conquering. If you control a battlefield at the start of your turn, you score 1 point. This is called holding. Q: How does the last point work? In order to win the game, you need to score the last point (the 8th point in most games, 11th in 2v2). If you try to score the last point by conquering, you will only get the last point if you have already scored all of the other battlefields this turn. Otherwise, you'll draw a card instead. So, in an 8 point 1v1 game with two battlefields: If you are at 6 points and conquer both battlefields, you'll go to 7 and then to 8 and win. If you are at 7 points and conquer both battlefields, you'll draw a card for the first one, and then go to 8 and win. If you are at 6 points, hold one battlefield to 7, and conquer the other to go to 8 and win. If you are at 7 points, you can hold one to go to 8 and win. In an 8 point 4 player FreeforAll game with three battlefields: If you are at 5 points and conquer all 3 battlefields, you'll go to 6 then 7 then 8 and win. If you are at 6 points and conquer all 3 battlefields, you'll go to 7 then draw 1, then 8 and win. If you are at 5 points, hold 1 battlefield to 6, then conquer the other two, you'll go to 7 and then 8 and win. Movement Q: What's the standard move? Every unit has the natural ability to move itself from base to battlefield, or back from battlefield to base, during your Main Phase (on your own turn, outside of a showdown). To do this, you pay the cost (exhausting the unit) and then move the unit. If a unit is exhausted, you can't move it using the standard move. Q: Do I have to exhaust a unit when I move it with a spell or ability? Moving a unit with a spell or ability won't change its ready or exhausted state unless the effect specifies that it does. The cost of using a unit's standard move is to exhaust that unit, but that isn't a cost or effect of other moves. Q: Can I move multiple units together to a battlefield? Yes, you can use the standard move of your units all at once to move them as a group together to the same legal destination. To do this, exhaust them all (the cost of the standard move) and then move them to the destination, then resolve any move effects, then start a showdown if needed. Q: Does Ganking allow a unit to move an extra time? When can I use the Ganking ability? No, Ganking is an extra way to use the standard move. Normally, when a unit uses the standard move, it can only move between base and battlefield. If a unit has Ganking, it can also move between two battlefields. You can move units with Ganking alongside other units that are moving with the standard move, as long as the destination is legal for all units moving as a group. Q: Can I move more units in before a combat starts using a spell or ability? If you don't move units together as a group using the standard move, then you can only move additional units afterward if you use a spell or ability with the Action or Reaction keywords, after the combat starts as part of the showdown. Combat Q: What happens when both sides in combat have the same total Might? In this case, both sides will assign damage to the other side equal to the total Might of all units there, which will end up killing all units on both sides. No units will remain to control the battlefield, leaving it open and nobody will score a point. Q: What happens if units from both sides in combat survive, either because of Kayn or a stun? In this case, both sides will still assign damage to the other side as normal (stunned units will not deal damage). Units will still die if they are assigned damage equal to or greater than their Might (unless they don't die, for example because of Kayn's ability). Then if units from both sides remain alive at the battlefield, any remaining attacking units will be recalled to base and the defending player will maintain control (no score, though). Q: Do units heal from combat damage? When? Yes, units everywhere will heal from damage at the end of every combat and at the end of every turn. That means if a unit survives through damage assignment, it'll be back to zero damage at the end of the combat. Resources Q: How do runes work? What are energy and power? Can I recycle an exhausted rune? Yes, each rune has two abilities, and you can use both of them in the same turn: You can exhaust a rune to produce 1 energy. Energy is used to pay numerical costs, and doesn't have a domain/color associated with it, even though the runes used to generate it do. You can recycle a rune (even an exhausted one) to produce 1 power of that rune's domain/color. Power is used to pay color symbol costs. Rune abilities have the Reaction keyword, which means they can be used anytime. Q: Is there a limit to how many runes I can have? Yes, all Riftbound decks are built with exactly 12 runes, so once you have channeled all of them, you can't get more runes on the board. Q: Do Seals add energy? Do Seals enter exhausted like units do? No, Seals can't generate energy. They can be exhausted to produce 1 power of Seal's domain/color. Since you don't recycle them to make the power resource, you will be able to ready them and use them again on future turns. Q: How much do I pay for an Accelerate cost? Accelerate costs 1 energy and also 1 power of the unit's domain/color. Usually you'll do this by taking an additional ready rune of the appropriate domain/color, exhaust it, and then recycle that same rune. For example, if a fury/red unit normally costs [3] (or 3 energy) and you want to accelerate it, its total cost would be [4][R] (or 4 energy and 1 power of the fury/red domain). Keywords Q: What does Mighty mean? A unit is Mighty if it has 5 or more Might. Units don't have the keyword \"Mighty\"as long as a unit has 5 or more Might, the unit is Mighty. When you play a unit with 5 or more Might, you can exhaust your Relentless Storm Legend to channel a rune exhausted. Q: Do I get my Legion effect when I play a token or use an ability? No, Legion will only be active if you've played a card this turn. Tokens are not cards, and abilities aren't either. Hidden Q: How do I hide a card with Hidden? You can hide a card with the Hidden keyword from your hand instead of paying its normal cost. To do this, you must already control a battlefield (have units there) to hide the card at. Hiding a card costs [A] (one power of any domain/color) and you place the card face down at that battlefield. Q: When I hide a card, does that count for Legion? Hiding isn't playing, and doesn't count as playing a card for abilities like Legion. Q: If I hide a card, and then my opponent uses a spell to move a unit to that battlefield that same turn, can I play the card I hid? No. You can't play cards the same turn you hide them. Q: If I hid a card last turn, can I play that card even if I'm not reacting to another spell or ability? You can play them any time you can normally play a reaction, which includes when you're not actually reacting to anything. You're not restricted to playing them during showdowns at their own battlefield. Q: Do I have to play a unit I hid to that battlefield? Or can I play it to my base? A hidden unit must be played to that battlefield if able. Q: If I play a spell with targets that I hid, do I have to choose those targets from the battlefield I hid it at? Yes. If a hidden spell or a play effect of a hidden permanent chooses any targets, those targets must be chosen from among options at that battlefield, unless the ability explicitly restricts targeting in a way that makes this impossible. (We'll talk more about this later for specific cards.) Q: If I play a card I hid, and that card's effects include playing additional units (for example, tokens), can I play them anywhere? No. If a hidden spell or a play effect of a hidden permanent causes you to play a unit, you must choose to have that unit enter the board at that battlefield. Timing Q: Can I use the exhaust ability of a unit in combat? The cost of using an ability with the exhaust symbol is to exhaust that unit. If you just moved a unit into combat using the standard move, then you already exhausted the unit as the cost to do that, so you won't be able to use its ability with the exhaust symbol that same turn. If the unit is defending, it might be ready and then you can use abilities that require exhausting it in combat (as long as those abilities have the Action or Reaction keyword). Q: When can I use Vi's ability to recycle cards from my trash to increase her Might? Abilities can only be used in your Main Phase, outside of a showdown, unless they have the Action or Reaction keyword. Vi's ability does not, so it can't be used in combat/showdown. Q: Can I use my Legend ability on my opponent's turn? Abilities can only be used in your Main Phase, outside of a showdown, unless they have the Action or Reaction keyword. Some Legends don't have these keywords, so those can't be used on an opponent's turn. Q: I have a Reaction spell. Can I play it at the end of my opponent's turn? No. The only time you can do this is if another ability triggers at the end of your opponent's turn, such as the Dark Child Starter legend. Q: In a freeforall, can I play Actions and Reactions in a showdown that I don't have units at? Yes. Starting with the player who contested control/the attack, players each get a chance to play an Action or Reaction. Other players can then react with Reactions, but once everyone passes, the next player in turn order can play their own Action or Reaction. Continue like this until all players have passed on an empty chain, and then move to the end of the showdown. Miscellaneous Q: Is there a maximum hand size? No, you can have any number of cards in your hand. Q: Is there a maximum number of units I can have in my base? On a battlefield? No. You can have any number of units in a location. Q: What happens when I run out of cards in my Main Deck? If you run out of cards in your Main Deck, and then you need to draw 1, you will Burn Out. This means you take your Trash, recycle it into your deck, shuffle, and then choose an opponent to score 1 point. If you have no Trash to recycle when you Burn Out, then you'll grant an infinite number of points and pick an opponent to win the game. Q: What happens when I run out of cards in my Rune Deck? Nothing. You can't channel any more runes, but there's no penalty beyond that. Q: Do I put my Chosen Champion back in the Champion Zone when it leaves the board? No. Once you play a Champion from your Champion Zone, it acts like any other card from your Main Deck. When it dies, it goes to the Trash. Cards that Tell You Play Other Cards Q: What happens when a card like The Harrowing instructs me to play another card during its resolution? Do I play it while the other spell or ability is still resolving? What if I can't play it? To clarify the timing of these and other effects, we're introducing the idea of pending items on the chain. When you play a spell, or use an ability, they will be pending until you finish the steps of playing them before priority passes. When a spell or ability instructs you to play a card or play a tokenor when a triggered ability has its trigger condition metduring the playing or resolution of another card or ability, you'll perform the very first step of playing that card or using that ability by putting it on the chain, then stop. This chain item is still pending for now. You'll then process the rest of whatever is currently happening, including putting any other pending items on the chain above it. Then, in the order the items were put on the chain, each pending item's controller goes through the other steps of putting it on the chain: Make choices, pay costs, and evaluate legality. Only then is the pending item considered to have entered the chain. If it's legal to play and it's a unit or gear, it resolves immediately as usual. Once all pending items are done being fully added to the chain, play continues, and any items that remain on the chain can be reacted to. The most recent items to be placed on the chain will resolve first as usual. If at any point during that process that player is unable to proceed with playing the pending chain item for any reason, the item is removed from the chain and, if it's a card, is put back where it came from. This won't happen very oftenif you start the process of playing a card, you'll almost always be able to legally finish itbut it's a necessary failsafe to handle corner cases. Q: What about cards like Blind Fury and Promising Future, which let players look at or reveal cards from the top of a deck, play one, and recycle the rest? If I can't play that card, where does it go? It sounds like it's too late for it to be recycled as part of \"the rest.\" Hey, you're pretty sharp! For most cards that let you play something, it's easy to put the card back where it came from if you can't play it. The Harrowing would put it back in your trash, Ava Achiever would put it back in your hand, and so on. But when the card came out of a deck, which is both secret and randomized, it's not so simple. To provide a clear and easy answer to this question, four cards in set 1 that let you play other cards from decks are receiving errata. They'll each banish the card before instructing a player to play it. If the card can't be played for any reason, it just stays banished. This is a small functional change, but it's one we feel is well worth it to avoid the fuss of getting these cards back into a deck somehow. Baited Hook [1][C], [E]: Kill a friendly unit. Look at the top 5 cards of your Main Deck. You may banish a unit from among them that has Might up to 1 more than the killed unit and play it, ignoring its cost. Then recycle the rest. Blind Fury [Action] (Play on your turn or in showdowns.) Each opponent reveals the top card of their Main Deck. Choose one and banish it, then play it, ignoring its cost. Then recycle the rest. Dazzling Aurora At the end of your turn, reveal cards from the top of your Main Deck until you reveal a unit and banish it. Play it, ignoring its cost, and recycle the rest. Promising Future Each player looks at the top 5 cards of their Main Deck, banishes one, then recycles the rest. Starting with the next player, each player plays those cards, ignoring Energy costs. (They must still pay Power costs.) Q: So what exactly happens when someone plays Promising Future? Start with the player whose turn it isprobably Promising Future's controller. That player looks at their top 5 cards, banishes one of them, and recycles the other 4. Then each other player in turn order repeats this process. Each player can see which cards the players before them have chosen. Then, starting with the next player in turn order this time, those players put the cards they chose onto the chain as pending items, with the player whose turn it is putting their item on the chain last. Then Promising Future finishes resolving, and the players finish adding their pending items to the chain in the same order they were put there, ignoring Energy costs but still paying Power costs. They must pay mandatory additional costs (like the cost of Cruel Patron), and may choose to pay optional additional costs (like Accelerate). Each card that's a unit or gear resolves immediately, which may cause other things (such as play effects) to be added to the top of the chain as pending items. Any cards that can't be played for any reason remain banished. Once this process is done, any units or gear that were successfully played this way will be on the board, while spells chosen this way will all be on the chain in the same order they were put onto it. (This may result in spells that don't have Action or Reaction being on the chain above other items, which is usually not possible. That's fine.) Then, resolve the chain as normal. Q: What about Nocturne? Doesn't he also let you play a card from the top of a deck? Great question! Nocturne is his own thing. Speaking of which... Nocturne, Horrifying Q: OK, so what about Nocturne? How does his ability work? Is it a triggered ability? Can I use it if I \"reveal\" him, or only if I \"look at\" him? Nocturne has a few problems we'd like to address. His ability is worded like a triggered ability (\"when\"), but it can't really work like one. By the time a triggered ability could go on the chain, be reacted to, and resolve, you wouldn't be looking at Nocturne anymore. He has the same problem that the above cards do: you're trying to play a card from a deck (in this case, Nocturne himself), and it's hard to put him back there if you try to play him but can't for some reason. He is intended to be usable any time you're looking at the front faces of cards from the top of your deck, whether the effect in question says to \"look at\" them or \"reveal\" them. The rules will be changed to clarify that last onethey will now explain that to \"reveal\" means the same thing as \"allow all players to look at.\" Nocturne is receiving errata to solve these problems and bring him in line with his intended function. This errata makes it clear that this ability is not a triggered ability, and it uses banishment as a holding zone. It also specifies that revealing and looking both count; although we are handling that part at the rules level, we also want card text to reflect it unambiguously. Nocturne, Horrifying [Ganking] (I can move from battlefield to battlefield.) As you look at or reveal me from the top of your deck, you may banish me. If you do, you may play me for [A]. Q: So how exactly does this ability work? The process starts as you look at or reveal cards from the top of your Main Deck due to an effect. Let's use Stacked Deck as an example. You play Stacked Deck and look at the top 3 cards of your deck. Nocturne is among them. You now get to choose whether to banish him or not. If you choose to banish him, you immediately begin the process of playing him from banishment, placing him on the chain as a pending item. Then you continue resolving Stacked Deck. There are only 2 cards left of the original 3; you'll choose one to put into your hand and recycle the other one. Then, since Stacked Deck has finished resolving, you'll finish the steps of putting Nocturne onto the chain from banishment, paying [A] (that's one power of any type) instead of his base cost. As usual for units, he'll resolve immediately and enter the board exhausted. If you weren't able to play him for any reason, he'll just stay banished. Q: If I reveal multiple Nocturnes, can I play more than one? What if all 3 of the cards I look at for Stacked Deck are Nocturnes and I play all of them? Yes, you can play more than one Nocturne at a time this way. If there aren't any eligible cards left for the original effect you were resolving, any further instructions will be ignored. So if you reveal Stacked Deck, see 3 Nocturnes, and opt to banish and play all of them, you won't put any cards into your hand, nor will you recycle any cards. You will, however, have 3 Nocturnes. Q: So if Promising Future resolves and one or more players choose to banish Nocturne from the cards they looked at, what happens? As you go around in turn order and each player looks at their top 5, they can choose to banish one or more Nocturnes before they banish a card with Promising Future. Any such Nocturnes will go on the chain as pending items before whatever that player chooses with Promising Future. They'll remain pending through the whole process of resolving Promising Future, then at the appropriate point they'll be fully placed on the chain and (because they're units) will resolve immediately. Q: What about Dazzling Aurora? If I reveal Nocturne, do I get to play him and keep going? No, Dazzling Aurora stops when it finds Nocturne. Nocturne is revealed, then you may choose to banish him or not. If you banish him, you can play him for [A] using his own ability. If you don't, you can play him for free using Dazzling Aurora's ability (probably better, but you do you). Either way, you revealed a unit, so you don't keep going. Baited Hook Q: What happens if I use an effect like Unlicensed Armory to prevent the death of the friendly unit I chose to kill with Baited Hook? Baited Hook kills a unit, then uses information about \"the killed unit.\" If you prevent that unit's death, there's no killed unit, so Baited Hook can't evaluate its Might. As a result, the check for the Might of the \"killed unit\" returns a null value, and you're not able to play any unit. If the unit is killed before the ability of Baited Hook resolves, the outcome is the same. Convergent Mutation Q: The English version of this card is missing \"this turn,\" but the Chinese version includes it. Which is correct? The English version is a printing error. Convergent Mutation will receive errata to correct this oversight. Meanwhile, the Chinese version uses \"becomes\" language where the English version uses \"increase.\" We have opted to keep the \"increase\" wording from English, as these wordings work slightly differently Convergent Mutation [Reaction] (Play any time, even before spells and abilities resolve.) Choose a friendly unit. This turn, increase its Might to the Might of another friendly unit. Dune Drake Q: What about Dune Drake? It's missing \"this turn\" in both English and Chinese. This is also a printing error, one that wasn't caught in time to fix the Chinese version. It will also receive errata. Dune Drake When I attack, give me +2 [M] this turn if there is a ready enemy unit here. Ravenborn Tome Q: Is Ravenborn Tome supposed to be able to grant bonus damage to spells I play on later turns? No. This is another card that's missing \"this turn.\" Ravenborn Tome [E]: The next spell you play this turn deals 1 Bonus Damage. (Each instance of damage the spell deals is increased by 1.) Making Choices for Spells and Abilities (Targeting) Q: Some spells and abilities require choosing units, gear, or other things for them to affect. The rules say some of these choices are made when I put the spell or ability on the chain, but it seems like some of them can't be or shouldn't be. How do I know the difference? Riftbound uses a set of contextual rules rather than specific words on cards to determine which choices are made as a card is played. When a spell or ability chooses something else to affect, the rules refer to those choices as \"targets.\" Targets must be chosen as the spell or ability is placed on the chain, and they must still meet all targeting requirements as the spell or ability resolves. The next version of the rules will have more rigorous guidelines on which choices are targets, which we'll summarize here. For the most part, these rules don't change what choices are targets, they just spell it out more. An object or player mentioned in a spell or ability is a target if all of the following are true: something publicly visible to all players; that you and you alone choose; that isn't part of a targeting restriction, cost, trigger condition, replacement effect, or an action that \"must\" be taken. This explanation sounds complicated, but in general, most things that are affected by a spell or ability are targets. For a more precise breakdown of what each of those entails, see the Appendix. There are two other choices that are not considered targets, but are made while putting something on the chain. Those are: The location to which a unit will be played (normally either your base or a battlefield you control). The destination or destinations for any spell or ability whose effect is moving one or more units, whether or not it mentions a destination by name. Charm Q: So as I play Charm, I have to say not only what unit I'm moving it, but where I'm moving it to? Yes. This is a change from prior rulings. This means that move effects that don't mention a destination (like Charm) work the same way as those that do (like Showstopper). Q: What about when I use a unit's standard move? Does that target? No. The standard move is a special action that doesn't use the chain and can't be reacted to, so the concept of targeting doesn't apply. You announce which units are moving and what destination they're moving to, then move those units there immediately. Spells with Multiple Targets Q: If a spell has multiple targets, like Back to Back, do I need to choose targets for all of them to put the spell on the chain? Yes. You must choose two different friendly units to play Back to Back, although it still resolves even if one or both of its targets are no longer valid when it resolves. This is also true for activated abilities that have multiple targets. Abilities with Multiple Targets Q: What about triggered abilities with multiple targets, like Sona, Harmonious? The same is true of triggered abilities with multiple targets. For triggered abilities, however, this causes some cardsSona in particularto work in unintended ways. Going forward, we'll put the words \"up to\" on most triggered abilities. In the meantime, several cards are receiving errata so that their triggered abilities behave intuitively. Sona, Harmonious At the end of your turn, if I'm at a battlefield, ready up to 4 friendly runes. Targon's Peak When you conquer here, ready up to 2 runes at the end of this turn. Dark Child Starter At the end of your turn, ready up to 2 runes. Kinkou Monk When you play me, buff up to two other friendly units. (Each one that doesn't have a buff gets a +1 [M] buff.) Sigil of the Storm Q: Does Sigil of the Storm target? If it does, can I react to the trigger by recycling the chosen rune for Power? That seems weird. Sigil of the Storm is receiving errata using a new wording to make sure that it doesn't target. This uses a new wording, \"must,\" that indicates an action that must be taken. None of the choices made for such an ability are targets, and they are chosen as the ability resolves. Sigil of the Storm (revised text) When you conquer here, you must recycle one of your runes. FoxFire Q: Are the units I choose for FoxFire targets? What happens if some of them gain Might as a reaction? FoxFire is unusual (currently unique) in that its targets' legality is evaluated as a group rather than individually. The updated rules will explain how to handle this. As you play FoxFire, you'll choose any number of units at a single battlefield whose current total Might is 4 or less. Then, after any appropriate Reactions, FoxFire resolves and checks target legality again. If the units no longer meet the group targeting restriction because some of them have gained Might, you choose any number of the original targets whose Might adds up to no more than 4. Here are a few examples to illustrate. In all of them, FoxFire initially chooses 4 Recruits with 1 Might each, and some of those Recruits have gained Might before FoxFire resolves. One Recruit gets +1 Might. You can choose either to exclude that Recruit and kill the other three (total Might 3), or exclude one other Recruit and kill the 2 Might Recruit and two 1 Might Recruits (total Might 4). One Recruit gets +3 Might. You can choose either to exclude that Recruit and kill the other three (total Might 3), or exclude the other three and kill just that one (total Might 4). One Recruit gets +6 Might. You must choose to exclude that Recruit, because its Might alone takes you above your total. You must kill the other three (total Might 3). Two Recruits get +1 Might. You can either kill the two 2 Might Recruits, or one 2 Might Recruit and the two 1 Might Recruits. All four Recruits get +1 Might. You must choose two of the Recruits to kill, and the other two will survive. All four Recruits get +3 Might. You choose one Recruit to kill (total Might 4) and exclude the rest. All four Recruits get +6 Might. You no longer have a valid subset of targets, because even a single Recruit takes you over the Might limit. FoxFire does nothing. Q: Does that mean if the units I originally chose die, move, or lose Might as a Reaction, I can pick additional units at that battlefield to kill? No. You can only kill units from among the ones you initially chose. Dragon's Rage Q: Dragon's Rage also seems a little confusing under these targeting rules. What do I have to choose as I play it? Dragon's Rage works a little better now that move destinations are chosen at the same time as targets, but it's still kind of strange. Accordingly, it will receive errata with a new template for \"reflexive triggers\"triggered abilities within another spell or ability that create a new ability that goes on the chain separately from the original spell or ability. To show you what that looks like, here's the updated text: Dragon's Rage Move an enemy unit. Then do this: Choose another enemy unit at its destination. They deal damage equal to their Mights to each other That \"do this\" wording (or similar) tells you that what follows is a separate instruction from the original. As you start to play Dragon's Rage, you only need to choose an enemy unit and a battlefield to move it to. Then, assuming Dragon's Rage resolves, you'll put a separate triggered ability on the chain, choosing another enemy unit at its destination (if one is available). That triggered ability can then be responded to separately. If there's no enemy there, or if you didn't actually move the unit you chose for any reason (and therefore there's no \"its destination\" to reference), the trigger isn't put on the chain at all. This isn't a tool we expect to use often, but it lets us make sure that cards like Dragon's Rage offer chances for interaction and decision at points that feel appropriate. Disintegrate Q: How does Disintegrate work? Doesn't the damage kill the unit after the spell has resolved? Disintegrate is a funny oneit looks like it works, but the more you understand the rules, the more it looks like it might not work after all. Units dealt lethal damage by a spell aren't killed immediately, they're killed right after that spell resolves. To solve this little rules conundrum, we're using the new reflexive trigger wording here as well. Disintegrate Action (Play on your turn or in showdowns.) Deal 3 to a unit at a battlefield. If this kills it, do this: draw 1. Falling Star & Icathian Rain Q: That \"do this\" wording is a lot like the one on Falling Star and Icathian Rain. Are those reflexive triggers too? Yes! This means that these two spells no longer actually have any targets of their ownyou play them with no choices. If they resolve, you then put each instance of their reflexive trigger on the chain separately, choosing the same or different units as you like. You'll pay Deflect costs for each one as you put each trigger on the chain, and then the triggered abilities will resolve one at a time in the opposite order they were put on the chain. This is a big change to how those two cards work, but we think it actually matches how many people expected them to work when they first saw them. Twisted Fate Q: Twisted Fate too? Yes, Twisted Fate's \"do one of the following\" is also a reflexive trigger. 2v2 and Friendly Units Q: In 2v2, can my ally and I bring the same legend? What about the same battlefields? No and no. The updated rules will clarify that you and your ally must bring different legends and different battlefields. Q: When a card refers to a friendly unit, what does that mean? In most games of Riftbound, \"friendly [something]\" means the same thing as \"[something] you control.\" In our 2v2 team format, however, \"friendly\" includes both things you control and things your ally controls. Q: What about \"your units?\" Is that shared between teammates too? No. \"Your\" refers exclusively to things you control (on the board or on the chain) or things you own (everywhere else). Your units are the units you control, your spells are the spells you play, your trash is the one where you put the cards you own, and so on. Q: Can my ally and I share control of battlefields? No, you and your ally can never have units at the same battlefield. A maximum of two players can have units at a battlefield. Those players must be opponents, and a combat will result. Q: Can I move my ally's unit to my own base with Unforgiven, the Yasuo legend? Does that mean it's mine now? No, you can't do this. Any time you try to move something you don't control into your base, it moves to its controller's base instead. This is hardcoded in the rules, similar to how cards you own can ever be in your own hand, trash, or deck, even if something tries to put them in a different when. Similarly, you and your ally can never both have units at the same battlefield; the rules prevent any move that tries to make that happen. A few cards, including Unforgiven, were printed with English text that suggests misleading outcomes in these situations (but were printed correctly in Chinese). Those cards are receiving errata to clarify what they can and can't do. The Syren [1], [E]: Move a friendly unit at a battlefield to its base. Unforgiven [2], [E]: Move a friendly unit to or from its base. Portal Rescue Banish a friendly unit, then its owner plays it to their base, ignoring its cost. For The Syren and Unforgiven, this is not functional errata, just a clarification. For Portal Rescue, this is a slight functional change to its interaction with cards like Possession. Previously, you could use Portal Rescue to replay a card you took with Possession and retain control of it, but under the new wording this would give it back to its owner. Another card, Tideturner, is receiving similar errata and another clarification (see below). Cards with Hidden Q: When you play a card from hidden, it gains several additional restrictions. The rules were somewhat unclear on this. That's not a question. But alright, let's spell out the restrictions more clearly: A hidden unit must be played to that battlefield if able. If a hidden spell or a play effect of a hidden permanent chooses any targets, those targets must be chosen from among options at that battlefield, unless the ability explicitly restricts targeting in a way that makes this impossible. If a hidden spell or a play effect of a hidden permanent causes you to play a unit, you must choose to have that unit enter the board at that battlefield. Tideturner Q: What do the Hidden changes mean for Tideturner? It seems like I'm supposed to be able to choose a unit at another location. Tideturner is receiving minor errata, both to restrict its targeting to a unit you control and to make sure that it can target a unit at another location under these rules. Tideturner [Hidden] (Hide now for [A] to react with later for [0].) When you play me, you may choose a unit you control at another location. Move me to its location and it to my original location. Zhonya's Hourglass & Stand United Q: What about Zhonya's Hourglass and Stand United? When they're played from hidden, are their effects restricted to the battlefield where they were played? Only effects that choose are restricted. Zhonya's Hourglass saves the next friendly unit that dies anywhere. Stand United can only give a buff to a unit at the battlefield where it was hidden, but its other effect, which causes buffs to grant an additional bonus, applies everywhere. This is a change from previous rulings on these cards, intended to simplify the question of what hidden cards can and can't do. Zhonya's Hourglass has additional rulings and minor errata related to saving dying units; see below. Ava Achiever Q: Does Ava's ability let me hide cards? No, it lets you play cards with Hidden from your hand. Q: What restrictions does Ava place on the card I play? What does \"here\" mean? Ava's restriction of \"here\" is meant to apply only to units. She will receive minor errata to make this clearer: Ava Achiever When I attack, you may pay [C] to play a card with [Hidden] from your hand, ignoring its cost. If it's a unit, play it here. Pack of Wonders Q: What can Pack of Wonders return to my hand? Pack of Wonders can choose a friendly gear, a friendly unit, or a friendly facedown card hidden at a battlefield. It cannot return a card with the [Hidden] keyword from anywhere else, such as a player's trash. To make that clearer, it's receiving minor errata to say \"facedown card\" rather than \"[Hidden] card.\" Pack of Wonders [E]: Return another friendly gear, unit, or facedown card to its owner's hand. Q: Does this mean it can return a card from my deck to my hand? Those are face down... No. (Nice try, though.) \"Facedown card\" always means a card that's hidden facedown on the board unless a card's text specifies otherwise. Cards that Replace Units Dying Q: When I replace a unit's death with a card like Unlicensed Armory, does damage on the unit stay? If the unit died to lethal damage, doesn't it just die again? The intent behind these four cards is to save your unit from dying, whether it died due to direct kill like Hidden Blade or due to lethal damage. To better communicate this, these cards will receive updated wordings. Two of them, Highlander (from the Proving Grounds boxed set) and Unlicensed Armory, have straightforward fixes, adding \"heal\" and listing \"exhaust\" and \"recall\" as separate actions. Highlander [Reaction] (Play any time, even before spells and abilities resolve.) Choose a friendly unit. The next time it dies this turn, heal it, exhaust it, and recall it instead. (Send it to base. This isn't a move.) Unlicensed Armory Discard 1, [E]: Choose a friendly unit. The next time it would die this turn, you may pay [C] to heal it, exhaust it, and recall it instead. (Send it to base. This isn't a move.) Zhonya's Hourglass also has a slightly updated wording making it clearer that its ability applies any time a friendly unit dies, not just on the turn you play it. Zhonya's Hourglass [Hidden] (Hide now for [A] to react with later for [0].) If a friendly unit would die, kill this instead. Heal that unit, exhaust it, and recall it. (Send it to base. This isn't a move.) The Boss was mistakenly worded like a triggered ability. It's receiving updated wording to make it clear that its ability is a replacement effect. The Boss (revised text) If a buffed unit you control would die, you may pay [C], exhaust me, and spend its buff to heal it, exhaust it, and recall it instead. (Send it to base. This isn't a move.) When you conquer, ready me. Q: Can I use these cards to save a unit that's already in its base? What about one that's already exhausted? If I can't recall it, do I still exhaust it? Yes. You can save any unit that meets the description in the replacement ability's condition. For Highlander and Unlicensed Armory, that's any friendly unit. The actions you perform on that unit as a replacement are like the effects of a spell or ability; you'll do as much as you can: heal the unit (if it's damaged), exhaust it (if it's ready), and recall it (if it's somewhere other than its base). And yes, you exhaust the unit even if you don't recall it; as per the above wordings, we've changed the \"recall it exhausted\" language to make that clearer. Q: If I play Cruel Patron and kill one of my units for its additional cost, but one of these cards replaces that unit's death, does the cost still count as paid? Yes. You made the decision to pay the cost and took the action to pay it. What happened after that doesn't matter. Q: If a unit would be killed by Hidden Blade, but one of these cards replaces that unit's death, does the unit's controller still draw 2? Yes. Hidden Blade attempts to kill a unit, then says that \"its controller\" draws 2. Even if the unit doesn't die, it's still on the board and information about its controller is still available, so that player draws 2. This is different from Baited Hook, which requests information about \"the killed unit,\" and can't find any information if no unit was actually killed. Timing of Healing Damage at End of Combat Q: I have Garen, Commander at a battlefield along with a Recruit token. Thanks to Garen, the Recruit has 2 Might. My opponent's total Might during the combat damage step is 6, so they deal 5 damage to Garen and 1 to the Recruit. Does the Recruit die? No. Under the revised rules, combat damage is dealt, any units with lethal damage on them are killed, and then units are immediately healed of all damage before lethal damage is checked again. This means that if one of your units that died was providing a Might boost to other units, they're healed of any damage before losing that Might boost. This is a change from previous rulings that impacts cards including Captain Farron; Taric, Protector; Garen, Commander; and Darius, Executioner. Q: Does the damage from Kog'Maw's Deathknell ability happen before or after combat damage is healed? After. Kog'Maw, Caustic has a Deathknell ability that says \"Deal 4 to all units at my battlefield.\" Under the revised rules, all damage currently on units will be healed before Kog'Maw's Deathknell ability resolves. This does mean, however, that any units that survive his Deathknell will still have 4 damage on them after combat, and you can use a spell or another combat to finish them off. This is a change from previous rulings.. Unyielding Spirit Q: What counts as \"spell and ability damage?\" What does this card do? \"Spell and ability damage\" on Unyielding Spirit is meant to encompass damage dealt by spells and abilities, but not damage dealt by other things as a result of spells or abilities. It will receive errata to clarify this. Unyielding Spirit Prevent all damage that would be dealt this turn by spells and abilities. Q: So... What does this card do? Most spells and abilities that deal damage just say \"Deal 3\" or similar. Unyielding Spirit stops damage from all such spells and abilities. Other cards, though, specify a source of the damage. Damage dealt by spells is damage that a spell instructs you to deal without specifying that some other object deals it. Damage dealt by abilities is damage that an ability instructs you to deal without specifying that some other object deals it. (All damage dealt by abilities is also dealt by the object that's the source of the ability.) If a spell or ability instructs a particular object to deal damage, including the card the ability is on, then that object is dealing the damage, not the spell or ability. So Unyielding Spirit does stop damage from Void Seeker, Stormbringer, or Yasuo, Remorseless, but does not stop damage from Challenge, Last Breath, or Carnivorous Snapvine. Immortal Phoenix Q: What does it mean to \"kill a unit with a spell?\" It seems like Hidden Blade counts, but what about a spell that deals damage? A spell that causes a unit to deal damage? A spell that causes a unit to die in some other way, like Stupefy on a unit that has 1 more Might than it has damage currently marked on it? This is unclear under existing rules, so the updated rules will clarify. \"When you kill a unit with a spell\" triggers immediately after a spell you control resolves if either of the following is true: That spell instructs you to kill a unit during its resolution, and that unit is put into the trash this way. A spell instructs you to deal damage to a unit during its resolution, and that unit is put into the trash during the cleanup immediately following that spell's resolution. This includes \"direct kill\" spells you control like Hidden Blade. It also includes damage spells like Void Seeker, provided they mark lethal damage on the unit that immediately causes it to die. In all cases, the unit has to actually dieif that death is replaced by a card like Unlicensed Armory, then you didn't kill a unit with a spell. Notably, the following do not count as you killing a unit with a spell: You are instructed to kill a unit by a spell another player controls, even if the spell instructs you to kill the unit (e.g., another player's Cull the Weak). Another player is instructed to kill a unit by a spell you control (e.g., your Cull the Weak, if you don't kill any of your own units with it). You play a spell like Challenge that causes a unit to deal lethal damage to another unit. You use a spell to mark damage on a unit and the unit dies later in the turn, even if that damage later became lethal damage for any reason. You use a spell to directly or indirectly lower the Might of a unit, causing damage it's already taken to become lethal damage. For example: You use a spell like Stupefy to lower the Might of a unit that has already taken damage, causing that damage to become lethal damage. You use a spell like Charm to move a unit with damage on it away from Trifarian War Camp, indirectly lowering its Might and causing that damage to become lethal damage. You use a spell like Rebuke to return Lee Sin, Centered to its owner's hand, indirectly lowering the Might of a buffed unit at the same battlefield that has damage on it, causing that damage to become lethal damage. You do anything else with a spell that causes a unit to die in any other way than the two methods listed above, or at any time other than during or immediately after the spell's resolution. You do any of the above, but the unit doesn't actually die. Q: Can Immortal Phoenix return if it is the unit that was killed? Or if it and other units were killed at the same time? For example, can I Hidden Blade on my own Phoenix and immediately replay it? Yes. Triggers like this are evaluated immediately after the event that takes place, at which point Phoenix is in the trash. Void Gate Q: If a spell deals damage to one or more units at Void Gate and one or more units somewhere else, which parts of that deal Bonus Damage? The Bonus Damage from Void Gate is only for damage being dealt to units at Void Gate. It will receive errata to clarify this. (As a bonus, Bonus Damage will now be fully defined in the rules.) Void Gate (revised text) Spells and abilities deal 1 Bonus Damage to units here. (Each instance of damage the spell deals to a unit here is increased by 1.) Darius, Trifarian Q: If I play Darius, Trifarian as my second card in a turn, does he ready and gain 2 Might? Yes, this works. Triggers like this are evaluated immediately after the event that takes place, at which point Darius is on the board. Q: If I play Darius as my third card, does he ready and gain 2 Might? What if I play another card after him? No. If Darius isn't present immediately after you play your second card, he won't trigger that turn. Hallowed Tomb Q: Can this card only return the specific card I picked as my Chosen Champion? What about another copy of the same card? You can return another copy of the same card. Hallowed Tomb refers to \"your Chosen Champion,\" but it's quite possible that you won't be able to verify whether a card in your trash is the specific card you chose. For example, your Chosen Champion might have been played, returned to your hand, and then discarded; you wouldn't be able to prove to your opponent that it wasn't another copy of the same card. Because of this, the updated rules treat all copies of the card you designated as your Chosen Champion as interchangeable. Q: What about a different card with the same Champion tag? If Jinx, Rebel is my Chosen Champion, can I get back a Jinx, Demolitionist, because Jinx is my Chosen Champion? No. You can only get back a card with the exact full card name of the one you chose at the start of the game. Karma, Channeler Q: Does Karma trigger off of recycling runes? No. When the text of Riftbound cards refers to \"cards,\" it means Main Deck cards only. Karma's reminder text reflects this. Q: Does Karma trigger off of recycling cards into other players' Main Deck due to a card like Sabotage? No. The updated rules will clarify that regardless of who is instructed to do the recycling in card text, players always recycle their own cards. To reflect this, Karma is receiving errata. Karma, Channeler (revised text) [Vision] (When you play me, look at the top card of your Main Deck. You may recycle it.) When you recycle one or more cards to your Main Deck, buff a friendly unit. (If it doesn't have a buff, it gets a +1 [M] buff.) Sun Disc Q: Can I use Sun Disc's ability the turn I play it, counting itself for its Legion ability? Yes. Although Legion normally requires \"another\" card for spells and play effects, Sun Disc's activated ability is not Sun Disc. On subsequent turns, you'll need to play another card to turn on Legion. Symbol of the Solari Q: What does it mean for combat to be a \"tie?\" The updated rules will more clearly define what it means to win, lose, or tie a combat. A player wins a combat if only their units are present after combat damage has been dealt. A player loses a combat if the other player in combat still has units present and they do not (ie, if the other player wins). A combat ends in a tie if either: Neither player has units left at the battlefield (e.g. they all died to combat damage). Both players have units left at the battlefield (e.g. one or more units was ineligible to deal or receive combat damagestunned units, Kayn, etc). Winning a combat is not the same as conquering, although ordinarily the attacking player must win in order to conquer. Either the attacker or the defender can win, and each combat either ends in a tie, or has exactly one winner and one loser. When combat ends in a tie, all attacking units are recalled to their base and the defender retains control of the battlefield. This doesn't cause the defender to win the combat; it's too late for that. Q: Does Symbol of the Solari recall all units everywhere? No, just the units that were involved in the tie. It's receiving minor errata to clarify this. Symbol of the Solari If a combat where you are the attacker ends in a tie that would recall any of your units, recall all units at that battlefield instead. (Send them to base. This isn't a move. Ties are calculated after combat damage is dealt.) Q: So what does Symbol of the Solari do? Symbol of the Solari has a replacement effect that applies to a combat if 1) you are the attacker, and 2) the combat ends in a tie because both players have units remaining. Ordinarily this would result in your units being recalled and the defender retaining control, but Symbol of the Solari instead causes all units at that battlefield to be recalled, leaving the battlefield open and uncontested. Teemo, Strategist Q: What does this card do, and when can it do it? If I play him from Hidden during combat, does his ability trigger twice? We're issuing a rules update that changes how Teemo and other defend and attack triggers work, and we're issuing a minor errata for Teemo in accordance with it. We're also clarifying what his ability does and how many targets it has. This contradicts some previous guidance we've given on this card, as we've examined what it says, what it's intended to do, and what our rules can support. Teemo has a \"when I defend\" trigger. Under previous rules, attack and defend triggers happened only at the beginning of combat. Teemo's dual trigger condition was meant to cover thishe either triggered at the beginning of combat, or he triggered when you played him into combat. Teemo, Strategist (revised text) [Hidden] (Hide now for [A] to react with later for [0].) When I defend, choose an enemy unit here and reveal the top 5 cards of your Main Deck. Deal 1 to that unit for each card with [Hidden] revealed this way, then recycle the revealed cards. Under the updated rules, attack and defend triggers trigger any time a unit becomes an attacker or defenderwhether that's because combat began, because the unit was moved into combat using a spell or ability, or because the unit was played into combat somehow. (And yes, this means that a unit that starts in combat, moves out somehow, and then moves back can trigger these abilities twice. We think this is finemoving a unit at Action speed isn't easy to do, and doing it twice is even harder, so we don't mind there being a substantial reward.) One thing to note about this change that doesn't apply to Teemo directly: Assault and Shield are not attack or defend triggers, so they'll work the same way they did before. They apply while a unit is an attacker or defender in combat as appropriate, stop applying once the unit is no longer in combat, and start applying if it joins or rejoins combat partway through. This rules change makes the \"played from [Hidden]\" part of Teemo's text redundant. And since the ability only does anything if enemy units are present, we're issuing errata to clarify that it only triggers once as intended, whether Teemo is played into combat or was there from the start. We're also rephrasing the ability to make it clearer that it only has one target. Q: How many enemy units do I target with Teemo, and when do I choose them? Teemo has only a single target, an enemy unit, chosen when his triggered ability is placed on the chain. That ability will deal a variable amount of damage to that unit based on how many units with Hidden you reveal. This is a change from previous rulings. Q: Which cards count for Teemo? Does Ember Monk count? What about Noxus Saboteur? Teemo counts cards that have the Hidden keyword, but not cards that mention Hidden but don't actually have it. Ember Monk and Noxus Saboteur do not have the Hidden keyword. Wraith of Echoes Q: Does Wraith of Echoes trigger on its own death? No. Units don't \"see\" themselves die unless they have an ability such as Deathknell that explicitly allows them to. For clarity, we are issuing an errata that adds the word \"another\" to Wraith of Echoes. Wraith of Echoes The first time another friendly unit dies each turn, draw 1. Q: What about other units that die at the same time as Wraith of Echoes, such as to a mass damage spell like Unchecked Power? No. Units that die also don't \"see\" anything else that dies at the same time they do. Q: What happens if the first time a unit dies in a turn is actually two or more units dying simultaneously? Does it trigger twice? Just once. If an ability triggers \"the first time\" something happens and that trigger condition is met multiple times simultaneously, you'll pick one to count as the first."

These clarifications will be incorporated into the next iteration of the Core Rules. As part of these revised and clarified rulings, we have also updated some card wordings (this is called errata). We previously announced plans to issue errata via a database called Watcher. These plans are still in the works, and we'll update you when we can! This document has three sections: Outstanding Issues from the Origins FAQ, including some errata to Origins and Spiritforged cards Functional Errata for a small number of other cards in Spiritforged Rules Clarifications about cards whose intended function may not be obvious in the current rules The errata are also available as a separate document. This FAQ includes far fewer errata and rules revisions than the Origins FAQ, but it still includes more than we'd like. The reason for this lies in part with the long lead times for physical games. Spiritforged card text was already finalized when many of the rules and templating decisions in the Origins FAQ and errata were made, so some of this is just catching up. We expect the need for \"day 0\" errata to (continue to) decrease as our rules stabilize and our production catches up to the real world. We're well aware that the formatting and cadence of our rules guidance have room for improvement, and we're committed to making those improvements in the coming months. For now, though, we wanted to get clarifications and errata into players' hands in time for Chinese tournaments with Spiritforged cards. These clarifications take effect immediately. One other note about errata, as always: Errata may impact the effective power level of cards, but we have no plans to issue errata strictly for power level reasonsonly to make cards work within the rules and as intended. Throughout this document, we use some specific shorthand to represent symbols in card text. Here's a short guide: [E] means \"exhaust\" [M] means \"Might\" [A] means \"one power of any domain\" [C] means \"one power of this card's domain\" [C] in Accelerate costs takes on the domain of the unit, or turns into [A] if the unit has no domain or multiple domains. [C] in other cases is treated as the corresponding power symbol in all respects, matching how the cards are actually printedit's just a design shorthand! Origins FAQ Outstanding Issues and Errata Some categories of errata that we made in the Origins FAQ also apply to Spiritforged cards, but weren't made in time to be included in their printed versions. We've also got a few loose ends in Origins to tie up. Falling Star, Icathian Rain, and Deflect The Origins FAQ impacted these two Origins cards in ways that ultimately went beyond our original intentions for them, and we haven't been happy with the result. We'll turn over the mic to Riftbound Game Director Dave Guskin to talk about two prominent Origins cards that are receiving errata: Hey all, Dave here! As we developed more and more designs that needed to perform effects after an initial effect resolved, we added in a new type of trigger called a reflexive trigger. These triggers are the way that a spell or ability can use information from a first effect, and still allow other players to respond now knowing that information before the second effect resolves. We used a straightforward template (or formal wording) to identify reflexive triggers, the \"then do this:\" template. And because Icathian Rain and Falling Star were already using a similar template, I ended up pushing forward with changing those cards to reflexive triggers even though they didn't have a first effect information second effect kind of flow. This was a mistake, and we shouldn't have done thisit has a lot of weird unintuitive consequences for gameplay that make these two cards play different than one might expect, and also worse. For those reasons, we're changing these two cards to work the way other spells work and the way we think players want them to workthat is, you pick all the targets up front, the other player can react before any of it resolves, and then each of the units affected take the damage on resolution. You can still choose the same unit or different units for each choice. Falling Star (revised text) Deal 3 to a unit. Deal 3 to a unit. (You can choose different units.) Icathian Rain (revised text) Deal 2 to a unit. Deal 2 to a unit. Deal 2 to a unit. Deal 2 to a unit. Deal 2 to a unit. Deal 2 to a unit. (You can choose different units.) In addition to these card changes, we have a small rules change to make. We've realized that our design team and rules team weren't in agreement about how Deflect was supposed to work. In the rules, a target's Deflect cost was paid once for each spell or ability. In the design team's playtesting, it was paid once for each time that target was chosen. That misalignment didn't actually matterIcathian Rain and Falling Star had reflexive triggers, so they worked as intended, and there were no other cards (that we could find) that can choose the same unit multiple times. Now that difference does matter, both because of the above errata and the existence of the Repeat ability, and we want the cards to play as the design team intended. To that end, we're taking the unusual step of issuing errata for the rules themselves: Rule 735.1.c (revised text) It is functionally short for \"Spells and abilities an opponent controls that choose me cost an amount of Power equal to [Deflect Value] more to play as an additional cost for each time they choose me.\" Cards that Tell You to Play Other Cards from Your Deck Q: Origins cards that instruct players to play cards from their deck, like Promising Future and Blind Fury, received errata to banish those cards before playing them. Will Spiritforged cards with similar abilities receive similar errata? Yes! This is mostly a bookkeeping thingbanishing the card ensures that the game has a place to put the card until it's actually played, and a place to send the card back to if it can't be played for whatever reason. 99% of the time, these cards work the same with or without this errata, but we need to cover those weird corner cases. This impacts 3 Spiritforged cards, plus 1 Origins card that got past us last time. Rek'Sai, Swarm Queen (revised text) When I attack, you may reveal the top 2 cards of your Main Deck. You may banish one, then play it. If it is a unit, you may play it here. Recycle the rest. Void Burrower (revised text) When you conquer, you may exhaust me to reveal the top 2 cards of your Main Deck. You may banish one, then play it. Recycle the rest. Void Rush (revised text) Reveal the top 2 cards of your Main Deck. You may banish one, then play it, reducing its cost by [2]. Draw any you didn't banish. Reinforce (revised text) Look at the top 5 cards of your Main Deck. You may banish a unit from among them, then play it, reducing its cost by [5]. Recycle the remaining cards. Reflexive Triggers on Spiritforged Cards Q: Should the reflexive trigger system introduced in the Origins FAQ apply to any cards in Spiritforged? Yes! This is another one where if you don't know the finer points of the rules, you're probably already playing these cards correctly, but the machinery of the rules requires a slightly different wording than we thought. Reflexive triggers, identified by \"do this:\" language, create new chain items to handle things that need to offer players a chance to react, or just need to happen later than the rest of a spell or ability. This impacts 2 cards in Spiritforged, both of which let you play something and then try to do something to that thing. Arise! (revised text) Play a 2 [M] Sand Soldier unit token for each Equipment you control. Then do this: Ready up to two of them. Rell, Magnetic (revised text) Tank (I must be assigned combat damage first.) When I attack, you may play an Equipment with Energy cost no more than [2], ignoring its cost. If you do, then do this: Attach it to me. Spiritforged Functional Errata A handful of cards in Spiritforged were printed with text that either doesn't quite work, or technically works but goes against design intent and (we think) common sense. We're issuing errata to maintain these cards' intended function. Blood Rush Q: Should Blood Rush say \"this turn\" on it? It should! Like Convergent Mutation in Origins, the phrase \"this turn\" was accidentally omitted. Blood Rush (revised text) [Action] (Play on your turn or in showdowns.) [Repeat][1] (You may pay the additional cost to repeat this spell's effect.) Give a unit [Assault 2] this turn. (+2 [M] while it's an attacker.) Deathgrip Q: Is the first friendly unit on Deathgrip a cost or a target? When do I kill it, and what happens if I don't? Deathgrip uses a nonstandard wording that we normally avoid, precisely because of these ambiguities. We're issuing errata to bring it more in line with how other cards and abilities work. This errata establishes that 1) the friendly unit is a target, not a cost; 2) it is chosen along with the other friendly unit and killed as the spell resolves; 3) if you don't actually kill it for any reason, either because it's no longer a legal target or because you replaced its death with an effect like Zhonya's Hourglass, you do not give the second friendly unit any Might. (You do still draw 1; we've introduced a paragraph break to make that clear.) Deathgrip (revised text) [Reaction] (Play any time, even before spells and abilities resolve.) Kill a friendly unit. If you do, give +[M] equal to its Might to another friendly unit this turn. Draw 1. Edge of Night Q: Does Edge of Night's autoattach ability work? Because unattended gear at battlefields are recalled, Edge of Night does a strange little dance on its way to becoming attached, returning to your base while its ability is on the chain. And because of that dance, it's no longer \"here\" when the attachment is supposed to happen. We need to change its wording so it can still find the unit you chose. But we don't want any confusion herethe card works exactly the same as it did before. The Hidden rules still require that you choose a unit at the battlefield where you played it from face down. For that reason, we've included reminder text in the errata. Edge of Night (revised text) [Hidden] (Hide now for [A] to react with later for [0].) When you play this from face down, attach it to a unit you control (here). [Equip] [C] ([C]: Attach this to a unit you control.) Janna, Savior Q: Can Janna's play effect be used to heal my units without an enemy unit present? Triggered abilities in Riftbound can't be placed on the chain unless all required targets can be chosen. They can resolve and perform part of their text without all targets still being available, but all targets must be available to put them on the chain to begin with. This is weird, and we generally try not to force players to know it. We think 99% of players probably expect that Janna can heal their units without enemies present, so we're meeting that expectation with a simple \"up to,\" similar to some \"up to\" errata for triggered abilities in Origins. Janna, Savior (revised text) [Reaction] (Play any time, even before spells and abilities resolve, including to a battlefield you control.) When you play me, heal your units here, then move up to one enemy unit from here to its base. Jax, Unmatched Q: How does Jax, Unmatched work? Jax, Unmatched grants QuickDraw to Equipment in your hand, which works as far as letting you play them as Reactions... but doesn't work so well when the Equipment hits the board and the other part of QuickDraw tries to take effect. We're fixing that. Jax, Unmatched (revised text) [Deflect] (Opponents must pay [A] to choose me with a spell or ability.) Your Equipment everywhere have [QuickDraw]. (Each gains [Reaction]. When you play it, attach it to a unit you control.) Kato the Arm Q: Can Kato the Arm give himself his own Might and keywords? \"Friendly unit\" does properly include Kato himself, but that wasn't the intent behind this cardKato can't throw himself, after all. It was a simple goof that Kato made it out the door without the word \"another,\" and the gameplay is so divergent from the design intent that we're changing it to fix this error. Kato the Arm (revised text) [Deflect] (Opponents must pay [A] to choose me with a spell or ability.) When I move to a battlefield, give another friendly unit my keywords and +[M] equal to my Might this turn. Q: Does Kato give keywords he's gained during play? What about Might bonuses from various sources like Equipment? Yes. Kato gives his current keywords and additional Might equal to his current Might to the unit you choose. Later changes to Kato don't matter; what the unit gets is locked in as the ability resolves. Tianna Crownguard Q: Can I still conquer and hold battlefields while my opponent has Tianna? Do I get conquer and hold triggers? What about drawing a card instead of getting the 8th point from conquering? Riftbound rules and card text use the word \"score\" in a couple different ways. You can score battlefields; you can also score points, as on cards like Tryndamere, Barbarian. The difference between these two is usually clear... but Tianna muddles them more than we anticipated. Tianna is solely concerned with points and doesn't interfere with the process of conquering or holding battlefields. You can still conquer and hold battlefields and get your conquer and hold triggers. You can even draw a card if you conquer a battlefield and can't score because it's the final point and you haven't scored every battlefield yet. It's not until you reach for your scorepad, app, or tracking die that Tianna says \"No.\" The \"gain points\" meaning of score is underdeveloped in the current rules, so in the future we are likely to revisit the rules and/or card wordings for scoring points without scoring battlefields. For now, we're issuing errata to make Tianna's function clearer and leaving the rest unchanged. Tianna Crownguard (revised text) [Deflect] (Opponents must pay [A] to choose me with a spell or ability.) While I'm at a battlefield, opponents can't gain points. Q: Does Forgotten Monument work the same as Tianna? Will it receive similar errata? Forgotten Monument works differently from Tianna, and we agree that's confusing. That's part of why we decided to issue errata for Tianna (and not for Forgotten Monument). Forgotten Monument completely prevents the process of scoring there. That means no conquer triggers, no hold triggers, and no points from doing those things. \"Extra\" points such as those from Renata Glasc, Mastermind are unaffected. You can still gain control of the battlefield following a showdownyou just can't conquer it. Yone, Blademaster Q: When and how does Yone trigger? If you conquer a battlefield, is it still open? Yone's current text is a little, well, open to interpretation. A strict reading suggests that he can never trigger at allonce you've conquered a battlefield, it's no longer openbut obviously that's not the intent. We're tweaking his text to cue off the control status of the battlefield immediately before conquering it. This means that he works as intended, triggering at the end of a noncombat showdown in which he conquers. It also means that he now triggers in \"surprise defense\" scenarios, caused when units move around during showdowns and you wind up defending a battlefield you don't control. Yone, Blademaster (revised text) [Weaponmaster] (When you play me, you may [Equip] one of your Equipment to me for [A] less, even if it's already attached.) When I conquer a battlefield that was uncontrolled, deal damage equal to my Might to an enemy unit in a base. Rules Clarifications There are a few cards in Spiritforged whose function isn't entirely clear, not because of anything wrong with their text, but because the rules don't support them as well as they should. A future rules update will fix these oversights, but in the meantime, we'd like to offer guidance on how these cards should be played. Draven, Audacious Q: What does it mean to win or lose a combat? Winning and losing combats is a system that was inadvertently left out of the most recent rules update. Here are the conditions under which you win, lose, or tie a combat. After combat damage has been dealt: If neither player has units remaining at the battlefield or both players have units remaining, combat is a tie. If both players do, attackers are recalled. If only one player has units remaining at the battlefield, that player wins the combat and the other player loses. Draven triggers if he's among the units that survive. It doesn't matter whether combat damage was actually dealt, only that there was a combat showdown and only your units were left after combat damage. If you killed or removed all the opposing units with spells and abilities before Draven had to throw any punches, he still wins. (Think of it as winning by default.) You can win a combat on either offense or defense. Q: If I win on the attack and conquer, does this happen before or after I score? Before or after conquer effects? Draven's ability will trigger and resolve before you gain your regular point for scoring the battlefield and before any conquer effects are triggered. This means that you can't win from 6 points by conquering a battlefield with Draven without having scored all other battlefieldsyou'll gain your point from Draven, then the game will see that you're at 7 points and give you a card draw instead of a point for conquering. Pickpocket Q: Can Pickpocket kill a Gold token? Yes, but we see why you'd ask. The rules use a \"NULL\" system for values that aren't available, such as the Might of a unit that's been removed from the board. The unit is gone and the information is missing, so you can't do any calculations or comparisons with it (not even \"is it no more than 1?\"). That system could reasonably be applied to the costs of tokens, but we feel that results in unintuitive situations, like not being able to kill a Gold token with Pickpocket. After all, the token's not missing; it just doesn't have a cost because it doesn't need one. We'll be updating the rules to clarify that the cost of a token can be treated as 0 for all purposes. Rumble, Hotheaded Q: Can Rumble, Hotheaded choose a Mech token to recycle? If he does, where does it go? Yes, he can. This is a minor gap in the rules. Main Deck cards are recycled to the Main Deck and runes are recycled to the Rune deck, but tokens aren't actually either of those things. We'll be clarifying in a future rules updates that tokens \"inherit\" the recycle destination of their type(s), so a token that's a unit or gear is recycled to your Main Deck just like any other gear. It then vanishes, as tokens do any time they leave the board, but it still counts as \"the unit you recycled\" and Rumble can check its Might. Svellsongur Q: Does Svellsongur copy text that the unit has gained from other sources, such as the Assault granted by Cleave? What about text it's gained from other Equipment? No, Svellsongur only copies the text that's actually printed on the unit. This is an ambiguity in the current rules, which refer to \"appending\" and \"removing\" rules text without reference to whether that text is original to the unit or not. The key word here is actually copy, a system that will be fleshed out in a future rules update. For now, we'll just tell you that copies of objects or text take on their original traits, without regard to any subsequent alterations. Svellsongur doesn't grant the unit additional \"copies\" of the abilities of other Equipment. So putting 3 Svellsongur on the same unit will give that unit four total instances of its abilities, not eight. (Four should be plenty.) Q: Aphelios, Exalted has an ability that triggers when I attach an Equipment to him and tells me to \"choose one that hasn't been chosen this turn.\" If I attach Svellsongur to him, does he have the second copy of his ability in time for both to trigger? And do I have to choose different options? He does have the second copy of his ability in time, and it will trigger. The \"one that hasn't been chosen this turn\" restriction applies separately to each instance of his ability. So you could choose the same option for both, but you'll have to track which options you've used for each copy of his ability. Cards that Reduce Might Q: I heard that cards that reduce Might will no longer say \"to a minimum of 1\" on them. Does that mean Origins cards like Stupefy will receive errata? No. This is a change to our design philosophy beginning with Spiritforged, but Origins cards will maintain their functionality. Q: Does this mean that units' Might can go to 0 or below now? Units' Might could always go to 0 or below; it was just really hard to actually make it happen. For example: If a Recruit was at Trifarian War Camp, it would have 2 Might (its 1 base Might, +1 from War Camp). If it got hit with Stupefy, Stupefy would \"snapshot\" at 1 Might, reducing the Recruit's Might to 1. If the Recruit then moved away from Trifarian War Camp, it would lose the +1 Might bonus and end up at 0 Might. It's much easier to make it happen with Spiritforged cards, though, so it's worth reviewing the rules for units with 0 or less Might. Q: Does a unit with 0 or less Might automatically die? No, units can stick around on the board with 0 (or less!) Might. They will die if they take any damage, but \"0\" is not a valid amount of damage, so it takes 1 damage to kill a unit with 0 or less Might. We realize that this is a little weird, but it's important to us that cards like Frigid Touch can't be used to actually kill units, only weaken them. Q: Does a unit with negative Might contribute negative damage to my Might total in combat? No. Negative Might is treated as 0 Might for the purposes of dealing damage, but as its true value for raising it back above 0. So a unit with 3 Might would contribute 0 damage in combat, would die if it was dealt 1 or more damage, and would require +4 Might to get it back up to 1 Might. Ezreal, Prodigy Q: What costs does Ezreal, Prodigy reduce? Does he reduce Repeat costs? Accelerate costs? Equip costs? Ezreal, Prodigy reduces additional costs that are optional to pay. These will generally use both the words \"additional cost\" and the word \"may.\" Repeat and Accelerate are the two main sources of optional additional costs, but Ezreal can also offer a discount for oneoff oddballs like Blast Corps Cadet. Ezreal can't reduce Equip costs. That's an activation cost for an ability, so it's neither optional nor additional. There aren't currently any optional additional costs that apply to activating abilities. Q: What about Deflect costs? Aren't those optional now? No, Ezreal won't help with Deflect costs, and Deflect is not optional. Deflect is a mandatory additional cost, meaning you must pay it if you want to finalize a spell or ability that chooses something with Deflect. It's true that you can choose not to pay Deflect costs for triggered abilities by choosing not to finalize them, but that doesn't make it an optional cost. Hostile Takeover Q: If I use Hostile Takeover to take control of my opponent's only unit at a battlefield, will there be a showdown? Will it be a combat? You'll start a noncombat showdown. (Hostile Takeover's reminder text is a little misleading in this regardyou have to have some kind of showdown before you can conquer.) This ruling applies any time you have a unit at a battlefield when your opponent still controls that battlefield, but doesn't have any units there. (Yes, that can happen. Hostile Takeover and Stormbringer are the easiest ways to do it.) There's a gap in the current rules that leaves this situation without an obvious outcome. We plan to address that gap in the next regular rules update. The issue is surprisingly complex, and we're not 100% sure what the answer will be when we're done. In the meantime, though, we believe starting a noncombat showdown is the least disruptive way to handle this scenario. If you need really precise timing: assume that your opponent loses control of the battlefield in the same cleanup that begins the showdown, even though ordinarily control is \"frozen\" once the battlefield becomes contested. Temporal Portal Q: What parts of a spell does the Repeat ability cause to be repeated? Is it the entire effect? If I use Temporal Portal to give Find Your Center Repeat and pay the cost while its cost reduction applies, does the cost reduction happen once or twice, and does the final spell cost 2 or 4? Repeat causes you to repeat execution of a spell's \"instructions,\" which are the things the spell tells you to do as it resolves. (We'll give a better definition of \"instructions\" and how to define them in an upcoming rules update.) And the Repeat cost of Find Your Center isn't reduced, even when its base cost is, because anything that asks for a card's cost finds its printed cost as the answer. This means that Find Your Center's cost reduction applies only once and the final spell costs 4its base cost of 3, plus its Repeat cost of 3, minus its cost reduction of 2. Cards with Weaponmaster Q: The reminder text of Weaponmaster says \"You may\", but the Core Rules reads like it is mandatory. Which is it? Oh, sharp catch. Weaponmaster as a keyword is always meant to be optional. While the rules utilize a language structure that imply a mandatory target, the reminder text is more accurate here. It is always a choice on whether or not to use this play ability. We will clean up that language in the future."

Effects that rely on that target will not apply. Combat Winning and Losing Timing Combat winners are determined during the cleanup step after damage and healing are applied. Deathknell abilities trigger first, followed by \"win a combat\" triggers. Repeated Spell Resolution A repeated spell does not resolve again if it is banished during execution. Only the first legal resolution applies. Hidden Blade (Repeated) If both instances of the repeated Hidden Blade are targeting the same unit, you draw two cards total. As the card resolves, the repeated effect does not have a legal target, so no additional effect occurs. Combat Effect Expiration Combat effects expire before conquering and scoring. Combat bonuses do not apply during conquer triggers once they have expired. Soraka + Guardian Angel and Death Replacement Soraka in base + unit in base: unit is saved Soraka on battlefield + unit on battlefield: unit is not saved Soraka on battlefield + unit in base: unit may be saved Volibear, Imposing \"When an opponent moves to a battlefield\" is currently treated as if it were \"whenever one or more enemy units move to a battlefield.\" If you control Volibear at Battlefield A and Charm your opponent's Stalwart Poro onto Battlefield B, you will draw 1 card. If you control Volibear at Battlefield A, and an opponent moves two Stalwart Poros into a showdown at Battlefield B, you will draw 1 card. Jax, Grandmaster at Arms If you activate Jax's second ability targeting a unit and an Equipment already attached to that unit, the equipment will detach, then reattach. Repeated Temptation If two units exist at different locations, both may be targeted. If one target becomes illegal during resolution, only the remaining legal effects resolve. Tideturner Targeting Tideturner's trigger is optional. The controller of Tideturner may choose to trigger it when it is played and add it to the chain. It must have a legal target to be added to the chain. Multiple Cost Reductions Apply each cost reduction one at a time, in any order. Tournament Policy Rounds last 60 minutes, followed by three additional turns. Intentional draws and concessions are allowed. Players may take notes during games. Gameplay Situations Slow Play Judges may issue penalties for Slow Play, beginning with a Warning and upgrading as needed. Incorrect Sequencing Players do not lose triggers solely due to incorrect sequencing if they clearly demonstrate awareness of those triggers. Decks, Cards, and Logistics Booster packs with incorrect rarity may not be replaced unless the issue is severe. Dice may be used to track numeric values such as battle might.

Riftbound Core Rules Last Updated: 20251201 000. Golden and Silver Rules 001. Golden Rule 002. Card text supersedes rules text. Whenever a card fundamentally contradicts the rules, the card&#x27;s indication is what is true. 050. Silver Rule 051. Card text uses different terminology than rules. Card text should be interpreted according to these rules, not as though it were text within these rules. 052. Card , when written in card effects, is shorthand for &quot; Main Deck card.&quot; Runes, legends, and battlefields are not considered cards when executing the abilities and effects of game objects. They are considered cards for the purposes of these rules. 053. Cards refer to themselves in the first person. 053.1. Units and legends say &quot;I,&quot; &quot;me,&quot; etc. 053.2. Gear and spells say &quot;this.&quot; 053.3. Battlefields say &quot;here.&quot; 054. &quot;Can&#x27;t beats Can&quot; 054.1. Cards that forbid actions or effects, as a broad method of determination, supersede cards that allow or permit that same action or effect. 055. When executing card text, do as much as you can, ignoring impossible instructions. 055.1. If all of a card&#x27;s instructions are impossible, it is still played and resolved, but nothing happens. 100. Game Concepts 101. Deck Construction 102. Riftbound is a Trading Card Game where a player must provide their own cards to play against other players. 103. To play Riftbound , a player must have two Decks, a Champion Legend , and a number of Battlefields determined by the Mode of Play. 103.1. 1 Champion Legend 103.1.a. This is placed in the Legend Zone at the start of the game. 103.1.b. This will dictate the Domain Identity of the Main Deck. 103.1.b.1. Cards included in your Deck must abide by your Domain Identity. 103.1.b.2. Your deck&#x27;s Domain Identity is dictated by the domains of your Champion Legend. In the default card frame, these domains appear as symbols in the legend&#x27;s upper left corner. 103.1.b.3. If a card has a single Domain , then that card is permitted in the Domain Identity that corresponds to the same Domain. 103.1.b.4. If a card has more than one Domain , then that card is permitted only in a Domain Identity that contains all of the indicated Domains on that card. 103.2. A Main Deck of at least 40 cards 1 Chosen Champion Unit Units Gear Spells 103.2.a. Chosen Champion 103.2.a.1. This will be placed in the Champion Zone at the start of the game. 103.2.a.2. Must be a champion unit with a champion tag that matches the tag on your Champion Legend. Example: Loose Cannon has the tag Jinx . Therefore, a player could choose Jinx, Rebel or Jinx, Demolitionist as their Chosen Champion , because they also have the tag Jinx . Example: Tibbers has the tag Annie , but it is a signature unit, not a champion unit. It cannot be your Chosen Champion , even if your Champion Legend has the tag Annie . 103.2.a.3.

Example: Chemtech Enforcer in English and its counterpart in Chinese are considered the same card, despite the Name element on the card reading differently. 131. 4 Some cards have both a short name and a subtitle. For all purposes, including rules and deckbuilding, such a card&#x27;s name is &quot;[Short Name], [Subtitle]&quot;. Example: Kai&#x27;Sa, Evolutionary and Kai&#x27;Sa, Survivor both have the short name Kai&#x27;Sa, but they have different names.

Gear and their details are Public Information while on the Board. 146.1.a.3. Gear can be chosen, affected, or manipulated by spells, effects, or game actions that specify Gear. 146.1.a.4. Gear can be Killed. See rule 415. Kill for more information. 146.1.b. While in the Trash 146.1.b.1. Gear are treated as Cards before Game Objects , similar to the Hand. 146.1.b.2. They retain the properties of being Gear , but are not on the Board and thus cannot take actions or be affected by spells, abilities, or game actions that affect Gear on the Board. 146.1.b.3. Gear can be affected by spells and game effects that affect Gear in the Trash. 146.2. A Card Type 146.2.a. This is a unique identifier that some spells or abilities will use to restrict what they can choose or affect. 146.2.b. The card type is relevant in all zones. 147. Gear have several Intrinsic Properties unique to them. 147.1. Gear enters play Ready. 147.2. Gear can only be played to a player&#x27;s Base. 147.3. If a Gear is at a Battlefield for any reason, then it is immediately recalled to its controller&#x27;s Base as a corrective action. See rule 432. Recalls for more information. 148. Gear may have Activated Abilities. 148.1. Activated Abilities are Game Effects that are written as Costs followed by a &quot;:&quot;, and then succeeded by an effect. See rule 369. Activated Abilities for more information. 148.2. The Activated Ability of Gear may be executed at any time during the controlling player&#x27;s Action Phase during an Open State , and not during a Showdown. 148.2.a. This follows the same process as playing a card. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information. 148.2.a.1. This behaves, once activated, like a spell without an associated card. 149. Spells 150. Spell is a card type. 151. A spell can be played during an Open State Outside of Showdowns on its controller&#x27;s turn. 152. A spell is controlled by the player who played it. 153. A spell creates a game effect according to its instructions and is then placed in the Trash of the player who owns it. 154. When a spell is successfully played, a player executes the rules text of the spell. This is called Resolving the spell. 154.1. Spells have their rules text executed from top to bottom when they are Resolved. 154.2. If a later part of a spell applies a Replacement Effect that alters earlier parts of the spell, apply those replacement effects as appropriate. Example: A spell says &quot;Choose a unit. Kill it the next time it takes damage this turn.&quot; and &quot;[Legion] Kill it now instead. (Get the effect if you&#x27;ve played another card this turn.) &quot; If the Legion condition is satisfied, the unit is killed immediately and the instruction to kill it the next time it takes damage is ignored, even if the unit remains on the board somehow. 154.3. While a spell or ability on the chain is Resolving , no other spells or abilities can be finalized on the chain or resolved, including triggered abilities or game effects that would occur as a result of the execution of the spell. 154.3.a. Finish resolving all effects of a spell before addressing anything the spell may have triggered or caused through execution. 155. Certain Keywords on spells are not executable rules text, but instead intrinsic properties of the spell. 155.1. These determine inherent properties and behaviors of the spell before being played or while on the chain. 155.2. These keywords are: 155.2.a. Action 155.2.a.1. This indicates that, in addition to being able to be played during an Open State , this spell may also be played during Open States during Showdowns. 155.2.b. Reaction 155.2.b.1. Grants all cases and rules of Action. 155.2.b.2. In addition to all prior cases, may also be played during all forms of Closed State. 155.2.b.3. This will result in this spell resolving before spells and abilities that are already on the chain. 156. Runes 157. Rune is a Card Type. 157.1. A Rune is not a Main Deck card. 157.1.a. This means, despite remaining on the Board until Recycled or otherwise removed from the board, it is not a Permanent. 157.2. Runes are kept in the Rune Deck. 157.2.a. Exactly 12 Rune cards chosen during Deck Construction. See rule 103.3. Rune Deck for more information. 157.2.b. When a Rune is Recycled it is returned to the Rune Deck , not the Main Deck. See rule 403. Recycle for more information. 158. Runes produce the resources needed to pay costs. 159. Runes produce Energy and Power. 159.1. Energy is used to pay numeric Energy costs. 159.1.a. Energy has no Domain. 159.1.b. Energy has no type. 159.2. Power is used to pay Domainassociated Power Costs. 159.2.a. Power has a Domain. 159.2.a.1. Power &#x27;s Domain usually corresponds to the Domain of the Rune that produced it. 159.2.b. Some Power is Universal and can be used to pay for costs of any Domain. 160. Basic Runes 160.1. There are six Basic Runes , each with a Domain corresponding to its name: Fury Rune Calm Rune Mind Rune Body Rune Chaos Rune Order Rune 160.2. A Basic Rune always has the following two Abilities : 160.2.a. [E]: [Reaction] Add [1]. 160.2.b. Recycle this: [Reaction] Add [C]. 160.2.b.1. The Power added this way corresponds to the Domain of the Rune that is being Recycled. 161. Rune Pools 162. The Rune Pool is a conceptual collection of a player&#x27;s available Energy and Power available to pay Costs. 162.1. When a card adds Energy or Power, it is added to the controlling player&#x27;s Rune Pool . 162.2. Players must first add Energy and Power to their Rune Pool in order to be able to spend it to play cards or pay for Abilities with costs. 162.3. Energy and Power do not have a physical marker or tracker, although players may wish to use a physical tracker if they are retaining unspent Energy and Power over the course of their turn. 163. Every player&#x27;s Rune Pool empties at the end of each player&#x27;s draw phase and the end of each player&#x27;s turn. 163.1. Any unspent Energy or Power are lost. 164. All Abilities that include the action &quot; Add &quot; are abilities that are adding Energy or Power to the Rune Pool. See rule 416. Add for more information. 165. Battlefields 166. Battlefields are Game Objects. 166.1. Battlefields are Owned by a player. 166.2. Battlefields are not shuffled into Decks at the start of a game. 166.2.a.

Battlefields can be Destinations of moves. 166.6. Any number of Units can be present at a Battlefield. 166.7. Battlefields can be targeted by spells or game effects. 166.8. Battlefields can have Passive Abilities. See rule 360. Passive Abilities for more information. 166.9. Battlefields can have Triggered Abilities. See rule 375. Triggered Abilities for more information. 167. Battlefields are not Permanents. 168. The number of Battlefields on the Board is determined by the Mode of Play. 169. Legends 170. Legends are Game Objects. 170.1. Legends are Owned by a player. 170.2. Legends are not shuffled into Decks at the start of a game. 170.2.a. Legends are not played during the course of regular play. 170.2.b. Legends are established at the start of a game, and remain in place for the duration of regular play. 170.3. Legends cannot be Killed during the course of regular play. 170.4. Legends cannot be Moved. 170.5. Legends can be targeted by spells or game effects. 170.6. Legends can have Passive Abilities. See rule 360. Passive Abilities for more information. 170.7. Legends can have Triggered Abilities. See rule 375. Triggered Abilities for more information. 170.8. Legends can have Activated Abilities. See rule 369. Activated Abilities for more information. 171. Legends are not Permanents. 172. Legends may have one or more Domains. 172.1. The Legend determines the Domain Identity of cards its owner can include. See rule 101. Deck Construction for more information. 173. Tokens 174. Tokens are Game Objects created by spells and abilities during play. 175. Tokens can be represented by anything. Printed tokens are included in Riftbound booster packs, but they are not required to play a token. 176. A token&#x27;s controller is the controller of the spell or ability that created it, unless the token&#x27;s type innately determines control or that spell or ability specifies that a different player is the token&#x27;s controller. 177. A token&#x27;s owner is the player who controlled the effect that created it. 178. The effect that creates a token may specify the conditions or circumstances under which it enters the board. These stipulations may alter the usual steps for playing a card. 178.1. The effect may state that the token enters ready or exhausted, if that state is contrary to the default for the token&#x27;s type. 178.2. The effect may restrict the location to which the token may be played. 178.3. The effect may grant temporary abilities or modifications to the token. 179. Tokens are not cards. 179.1. Tokens have some properties in common with cards. 179.1.a. Tokens are played by their owner if their card type is played, following all the applicable steps for playing a card plus any restrictions or modifications from the effect that created the token. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information. 179.1.b. Token units have a Might . 179.1.c. Tokens may have one or more tags . 179.1.d. Tokens have a type . They follow all rules for their type unless otherwise specified. Example: A token unit is a unit. It enters exhausted, can take the standard move action, deals damage equal to its Might in combat, is destroyed if it takes damage equal to or greater than its might, can be chosen or otherwise affected by spells or abilities that choose or affect units, etc. 179.2. Tokens differ from cards in some ways. 179.2.a. Tokens do not have costs . 179.2.b. Tokens do not have domains . 180. Tokens are created on the board and cannot exist elsewhere. 180.1. If a token is put into any NonBoard Zone , it ceases to exist immediately after moving to its new zone. 181. The spell or ability that creates a token specifies some of its characteristics. It may have other characteristics, as listed below. 181.1. A 1[M] Recruit token is a domainless unit token with 1 Might and the Recruit tag. 181.2. A 3[M] Sprite token with Temporary is a domainless unit token with 3 Might, the Fae tag, and the Temporary keyword. See rule 742. Temporary for more information. 182. Control 183. Control is the concept of a player having influence of a Game Object and applies differently to different card types. 184. Battlefields 184.1. Control is established over Battlefields through the course of play. 184.2. Control is a binary state for Battlefields and an Identifier for players. 184.2.a. A Battlefield is Controlled or Uncontrolled. 184.2.b. A Battlefield is Controlled by a specific player or Controlled by no one. 184.3. Control can be Contested through the course of play. 184.3.a. Contested is a temporary status applied to the battlefield when a Unit controlled by a Player who does not currently Control that Battlefield Moves or otherwise becomes present there. 184.3.a.1. Units moving to or being played to a battlefield apply Contested status if that battlefield is not already contested and that Unit &#x27;s controller does not already control that battlefield. 184.3.b. A Battlefield remains Contested until Control is established or reestablished. 184.3.c. While a Battlefield remains Contested, Control of a Battlefield cannot change. 184.3.d. The state of a Battlefield being Contested is used to determine when Combat should occur, when a Showdown without a Combat should occur, and when Control will change. 184.3.e. At this time Game Effects cannot reference this status. 184.4. Control is established by having Units at a Battlefield at the end of a Showdown or Combat after applying the contested status. 184.4.a. If a player controls Units at a Battlefield, outside of Combat , they maintain Control of that Battlefield for as long as they have Units at that Battlefield. 184.4.b. A player maintains control of a Battlefield while it is being Contested by an opponent. 184.4.c. If a player has no Units at a Battlefield, they lose Control of that Battlefield immediately, unless it is Contested. 184.5. Control is a constant state. 184.6. Control of a Battlefield determines Control of its Abilities. 184.6.a. While a Battlefield is Controlled , its Controller controls its Abilities . That player takes responsibility for adding them to the Chain if applicable, and makes all choices required by them unless otherwise specified. 184.6.b. While a Battlefield is Uncontrolled , its Abilities are also Uncontrolled. The Turn Player takes responsibility for adding them to the Chain if applicable, makes all choices required by them unless otherwise specified, and is treated as their Controller if any game rule or effect requires one. Example: The Arena&#x27;s Greatest is a battlefield that reads &quot;At the start of each player&#x27;s first Beginning Phase, that player gains 1 point.&quot; This ability will usually trigger while the battlefield has no controller. If it does, the Turn Player goes through the steps of adding the ability to the chain and receives priority after doing so, exactly as if they controlled the ability. 184.6.c. &quot;You&quot; in a battlefield&#x27;s abilities refers to the battlefield&#x27;s Controller , as does the implied &quot;you&quot; in instructions like &quot;draw 1.&quot; If the battlefield has no Controller , &quot;you&quot; refers to no one, and all such instructions are ignored. 185. Everything Else 185.1. When a player Plays a Card or other Game Object , they are established as that Game Object&#x27;s Controller. 185.2. For Spells , they are the Spell&#x27;s Controller. 185.2.a. That player chooses targets. 185.2.b. That player chooses modes. 185.2.c. That player pays costs. 185.3. For Permanents and Runes , when they Enter the Board , that player is assigned as that Game Object&#x27;s Controller. 185.3.a. That player may make decisions about the Game Object&#x27;s Inherent Abilities. 185.3.b. That player may make decisions about the Game Object&#x27;s Unique Abilities. 185.3.c. That player may make decisions about any game effects or decisions necessary while the card is being played. 185.3.d. That player may make decisions about any game effects created from &quot;When you play me&quot; effects of Permanents. 185.4. For Abilities , they are the Ability&#x27;s Controller. 185.4.a. By default, the Controller of an Ability&#x27;s Source is the Controller of that Ability. 185.4.b. Changes to Control of an Ability&#x27;s Source do not change Control of that Ability. 185.4.c. That player chooses targets. 185.4.d. That player chooses modes. 185.4.e. That player pays costs. 186. When a game effect or rules text refers to the Controller of a specific object, it can be referring to either context interchangeably. 186.1. The method of assignment of control is different, but the status of Control is the same across all Game Objects. 300. Playing the Game 301. The Turn 302. Play continues cyclically until one player wins. 303. The phases of a turn are rigid, but the actions taken during those steps can be done in any order, unless otherwise specified. 303.1. Game Actions of any nature are performed one at a time and are executed completely. 303.2. Game Actions cannot be performed simultaneously for any reason. 303.2.a. If one or more actions, game effects, or Triggered Abilities are activated simultaneously, then Turn Order is referenced to organize the sequence of actions. See rule 375. Triggered Abilities for more information. 304. The Turn Player is the player taking the current turn. 305. When there are no items on the Chain and the Turn Player cannot or chooses not to perform any Discretionary Actions , the current phase or step of the turn ends and the next phase, step, or turn begins. 306. The Turn Player changes when the current Turn Player reaches the End of all of the Phases of their Turn. 307. States of the Turn 308. At any given time, the turn is in either a Neutral State or a Showdown State. 308.1. If a Showdown is in progress, the turn is in a Showdown State. 308.1.a. Only cards and abilities with the Action or Reaction keywords can be played or activated in a Showdown State. 308.2. If no Showdown is in progress, the turn is in a Neutral State. 309. At any given time, the turn is in either an Open State or a Closed State. 309.1. If a Chain exists, the turn is in a Closed State. 309.1.a. Only cards and abilities with the Reaction keyword can be played or activated in a Closed State. 309.2. If no Chain exists, the turn is in an Open State. 310. These descriptions can be combined, such that the turn is always in one of these four states: 310.1. Neutral Open: There is no Showdown in progress and no Chain exists. 310.1.a. By default, cards can be played and abilities activated only when a player has priority on their turn in a Neutral Open state. 310.2. Neutral Closed: There is no Showdown in progress and a Chain exists. 310.3. Showdown Open: A Showdown is in progress and no Chain exists. 310.4. Showdown Closed: A Showdown is in progress and a Chain exists. 311. Priority and Focus 312. At any given time, up to one player has Priority. 312.1. Priority is the singular exclusive right to take Discretionary Actions. See rule 398.1. Discretionary Actions for more information. 312.1.a. The player with Priority can take appropriately timed Discretionary Actions. 312.1.b. If no player has Priority , no player can take Discretionary Actions. 312.1.b.1. Players can always take and make choices for Limited Actions when instructed, regardless of Priority. 312.2. A player receives Priority at the following times: 312.2.a. When the turn is in a Neutral Open State during their Action Phase. 312.2.b. When the turn is in a Showdown State and they gain Focus. 312.2.c. When the turn is in a Closed State and they control the next item on the Chain. 312.2.d. When the turn is in a Closed State , they are the next Player in Turn Order , and the player with Priority passes. 312. 3 When a player is granted Priority, it is either created if no player has it or taken from the player with Priority. 313. At any given time, up to one player has Focus. 313.1. Focus is the permission to take appropriately timed Discretionary Actions when the turn is in a Showdown Open State. See rule 307. States of the Turn for more information. 313.1.a. The player with Focus must obey any additional restrictions on which Discretionary Actions may be performed. Example: A player with Focus may not play spells or activate abilities that don&#x27;t have the Action or Reaction keywords. 313.2. A player who gains Focus also gains Priority. 313.3. A player who passes Priority retains Focus. 313. 4 A player may not make discretionary actions with Focus unless they also possess Priority. 313.5. If the turn is in a Neutral State , no player has Focus. 314. Phases of the Turn 315. Start of Turn 315.1. Awaken Phase 315.1.a. The Turn Player readies all Game Objects they control that are able to be readied. See rule 402. Ready for more information. 315.2. Beginning Phase 315.2.a. Beginning Step 315.2.a.1. At the start of Beginning Phase game effects take place. 315.2.b. Scoring Step 315.2.b.1. Holding occurs at this time. See rule 445. Scoring for more information. 315.2.b.2. Reminder: In Modes of Play with Teams , Battlefields held by a Teammate of the Turn Player during this phase are disqualified from being scored this turn by the Turn Player. 315.2.c. Specific game effects or abilities will reference this timing and phase as necessary. 315.3. Channel Phase 315.3.a. The Turn Player gains their additional runes for the turn. 315.3.b. The Turn Player channels 2 runes from their Rune Deck. See rule 417. Channel for more information. 315.3.b.1.

As a result of a player taking Discretionary Actions , one or more structured phases may occur. 316.4. Combat 316.4.a. A Combat phase occurs as a result of Units controlled by opposing players being present at the same Battlefield . 316.4.b. This could be the result of a Standard Move Standard Action , a Spell , or other Game Effect. 316.4.c. The source effect does not change the structure or flow of Combat once initiated. 316.4.d. A Combat can only occur between two players. See rule 437. Combat for more information. 316.4.e. Play proceeds following the steps of combat. See rule 441.

Showdowns that occur as a result of Combat are a SubPhase of Combat. 316.5.b. A Showdown is marked as Staged at a Battlefield when the Contested status is applied to a Battlefield with no current controller. 316.5.b.1. Showdowns that occur as a result of a player moving to an empty Battlefield are a standalone Phase and do not create a Combat. 316.5.c. A Showdown is a structured Window of Opportunity where Players may play cards and activate abilities with Action or Reaction. See rule 337. Showdowns for more information. 316.6. When a player has no more Discretionary Actions they wish to execute, they must indicate they are ending their turn. 316.6.a. This ends the Action Phase. 316.6.b.

New Pending Items can be added, but Legal Items cannot be executed and Priority and Focus are not passed or awarded. 321. If an event occurs during a Cleanup that qualifies for a Cleanup, another Cleanup will occur immediately after the first completes, repeating until a Cleanup occurs with no new change in the game&#x27;s state. 322. When a Cleanup occurs, the following steps occur in order: 322.1. 1. If a player has as many points as the Victory Score , that player wins. 322. 2 2. Handle outstanding board state 322. 3 2a.

If there are Units present at the Battlefield the Combat is taking place at, but do not have a designation, they gain the same designation as their Controller now 322.5.b. If there are Units present at the Battlefield the Combat is taking place at, but have the opposite designation of their controller, they lose that designation, and gain the same designation as their controller now 322.5.c. If there are Units at locations other than the Battlefield that the Combat is taking place at, but have either Attacker or Defender designations, they lose those designations now 322.6. 4. Battlefields with no Units occupying them and no Contested status become Uncontrolled. 322.7. 5. Recall all Gear at Battlefields.

Finalize any Pending Items on the Chain 322.13. 9. If the current state is a Neutral Open State and one or more Showdowns are Staged , the Turn Player chooses one of those Battlefields. A Showdown begins there. 322.14. 10. If the current state is a Neutral Open State and Combat is Staged at one or more Battlefields , the Turn Player chooses one of those Battlefields . Combat begins there. 323. Special Cleanups are Cleanup steps invoked at specific times that have additional steps not present in a normal Cleanup. 323.1. When a Special Cleanup is invoked, the unique steps added will be inserted and defined by the subsection that invokes it. Example: When a Combat Cleanup is invoked, the Combat section defines what steps are added to the Cleanup. 323.2. If events during a Special Cleanup require another Cleanup, a normal Cleanup is invoked, not another iteration of the Special Cleanup . 324. Chains and Showdowns 325. Players can act during the following Windows of Opportunity that occur during the course of regular play: 325.1. During a Chain 325.2. During a Showdown 326. Chains 327. The Chain is a NonBoard Zone that temporarily exists whenever a card is played or an ability is activated. 327.1. Cards are placed here as part of the process of being played. 327.2. Abilities are queued here as part of the process of resolving. See rule 357. Abilities for more information. 328. Cards and abilities added to the chain are added as Pending Chain Items that become Finalized Chain Items. 328.1. Pending Items are on the Chain. 328.2. Chain Items are Pending until the &quot;Check Legality&quot; step of playing a card. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information. 328.3. When a Pending Chain Item is no longer Pending it is finalized and becomes a Finalized Chain Item . 329. The Chain exists as long as a Chain Item is on it. 329.1. Only one Chain can exist at a time. 329.2. If a card would begin to be played while a Chain already exists, it is placed on the existing Chain. 330. The State of the Turn is partially determined by whether or not the Chain currently exists. 330.1. The turn is said to be in a Closed State if a Chain exists. 330.1.a. Cards of all Categories, by default, cannot be played during a Closed State. 330.1.b. Card abilities, by default, cannot be played during a Closed State. 330.2. The turn is said to be in an Open State if no Chain exists. 331. Steps of Resolving Chain Items 332. Whenever a card or token is played or an ability is activated or triggered, a Chain is created. 332.1. The player that created the chain becomes the first Active Player. 332.2. The Active Player is a designator similar to, but distinct from, Turn Player. 332.3. Similar to the Turn Player , this designation will pass between players over the course of play. 333. Step 1: Finalize 333.1. If one or more Items are Pending , their controllers must complete the steps of Playing those Pending Items until they are Finalized Items or leave the Chain. 333.1.a. This process does not pass Priority. 333.1.b. Each Item is Finalized in the order it was appended to the Chain. 333.1.c. Abilities that Add resources, Units , and Gear resolve immediately when Finalized and do not progress to Step 2: Execute. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information. 333.1.c.1. If the Chain is empty, play proceeds in an Open State. 333.1.c.2. If the Chain is not empty and there are one or more Pending Items , repeat Step 1. 333.1.c.3. If the Chain is not empty and there are no Pending Items , the controller of the newest item on the chain gains Priority and becomes the Active Player. Proceed to Step 2: Execute. 334. Step 2: Execute 334.1. The Active Player may do any the following: 334.1.a. Play a Card that is legally timed. 334.1.a.1. Cards , by default, cannot be played during a Closed State. 334.1.a.2. A Legally Timed Card would be a Card with Reaction. 334.1.a.3. Other exceptions may be created during regular play. 334.1.a.4. The card will be added to the chain as a Pending Item , following the steps of playing a card. 334.1.a.5. This can be an additional card to the item that Started the Chain in the case of the first Active Player after creating the Chain. 334.1.a.6. Whether a Card is legally timed is evaluated during the &quot;Check Legality&quot; step of Playing a Card. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information. 334.1.a.7. Playing a card will create one or more Pending Items . Return to Step 1: Finalize. 334.1.b. Activate Abilities of Game Objects that are legally timed. See rule 386. Playing or Activating Abilities for more information. 334.1.b.1. All rules for legally timed cards apply to legally timed abilities. 334.1.b.2. Activating abilities will create one or more Pending Items . Return to Step 1: Finalize. 334.1.c. Pass Priority 334.1.c.1. The Active Player passes Priority to the next Player in Turn Order. Proceed to Step 3: Pass. 335. Step 3: Pass 335.1. If all players have passed Priority without adding any items to the Chain , proceed to Step 4: Resolve. 335.2. Otherwise, the Active Player passes Priority to the next Player in Turn Order. Return to Step 3: Execute. 336. Step 4: Resolve 336.1. The newest item on the Chain resolves. Execute its game effects in their entirety. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information on resolving spells. See rule 386. Playing or Activating Abilities for more information on resolving abilities. 336.2. If the Chain is empty, play proceeds in an Open State. 336.3. If the Chain is not empty and there are one or more Pending Items , return to Step 1: Finalize. 336.4. If the Chain is not empty and there are no Pending Items , the controller of the newest item on the chain gains Priority and becomes the Active Player. Return to Step 2: Execute. 337. Showdowns 338. A Showdown is a Window of Opportunity in which Players have an Open State in which they may play Spells in an alternating fashion. 338.1. Each spell played this way creates a Chain as normal. 339. The State of the turn is partially determined by whether or not a Showdown is in progress. 339.1. The turn is said to be in a Showdown State if a Showdown is in progress. 339.1.a. Cards of all Categories, by default, cannot be played during a Showdown State. 339.1.b. Card abilities, by default, cannot be played during a Showdown State. 339.2. The turn is said to be in a Neutral State if no Showdown is in progress. 340. A Showdown begins when Control of a Battlefield is Contested and the turn is in a Neutral Open State. 340.1. If Control of a Battlefield is Contested between two players, then a Showdown will be opened as the first step of Combat. See rule 437. Combat for more information. 340.2. If Control of a Battlefield is Contested and the Battlefield in question is uncontrolled when it becomes Contested , a Showdown is opened during the Cleanup at the end of the action that caused the Battlefield to become Contested. 341. As a Showdown begins, the player who applied Contested status to the Battlefield gains Focus. 342. When a Showdown begins, it may or may not begin with an Initial Chain. 342.1. Showdowns that open as a result of Combat may have an Initial Chain of Triggered Abilities. 342.1.a. These Triggered Abilities should be put on the chain first by the player with Focus , then proceeding with players without the Defender designation in Turn Order. Finally, the player with the Defender designation will add their Triggered Abilities , if any, to the Chain. 342.1.b. If there are no such Triggered Abilities present during a Combat initiated Showdown then no Initial Chain is created, but the Showdown will still proceed. 343. When the last item on the chain resolves during a Showdown , Focus passes, and the next Player gains both Focus and Priority. 343.1. Focus does not pass when the last item on the Initial Chain resolves, if there was one. Instead the player with Focus proceeds with play. 344. During a Showdown , the player with Focus may do one of the following: 344.1. Play a spell that is legally timed. 344.1.a. The spell will start a Chain as normal. 344.2. Activate Abilities of Game Objects that are legally timed. See rule 357. Abilities for more information. 344.3. Pass. 344.3.a. If all Players have passed once in sequence, the Showdown ends. 344.3.a.1. Perform a Cleanup. 344.4. Otherwise, Focus passes to the next Player in Turn Order. 345. If all players pass Focus without playing a spell or activating an ability, then the Showdown Closes. 345.1. If this Showdown opened as a result of Combat, proceed with the remaining steps of Combat to resolve the phase. See rule 441. The Steps of Combat for more information. 345.2. If this Showdown opened as a result of Contested being applied to a Battlefield without a controller, do one of the following: 345.2.a. If only one player&#x27;s Units remain at the Battlefield , and if that player does not already Control the Battlefield , that player establishes Control over the Battlefield . See rule 179. Control for more information on Control . See rule 446.1. for more information on Conquering . 345.2.a.1. This results in a Conquer if that player has not yet scored that Battlefield this turn. 345.2.b. If two players&#x27; Units remain at the Battlefield , Control cannot be established and the Battlefield remains Contested . This results in a Staged Combat . See rule 437. Combat for more information. 345.2.b.1. The player who applied Contested to the Battlefield will be the Attacker in the subsequent Combat. 346. Playing Cards 347. Playing a card is the act of a player utilizing their cards. 347.1. A card is Played when it has finished this process in its entirety. 347.2. Tokens are not cards, but can still be Played. See rule 173. Tokens for more information. 348. Cards have different behaviors when played. 348.1. Permanents become Game Objects when Played. 348.2. Spells create game effects that are executed, then the card is placed in the trash when Played. 349. Cards have different states during the process of being played. 349.1. When initially being played cards are Pending, as Pending Chain Items. 349.2. Near the end of the process cards will cease being Pending and become Finalized Chain Items . 350. The Process of Play 351. 1. Remove the card from the zone you are playing it from and put it onto the Chain. 351.1. This Closes the State. See rule 307. States of the Turn for more information. 351.2. This item becomes Pending. 351.3. If another Card Effect or ability is currently resolving, continue resolving it before proceeding with any further steps of this process. 352. 2. Make necessary choices. 352.1. If the card is a spell, or has an effect that specifies a choice &quot;As I am played,&quot; those choices are made now. 352.2. For Units , choose a valid Location where that Unit will be placed upon being Played. 352.2. a By default, Valid locations include the controller&#x27;s Base or a Battlefield the controller controls. 352.2. b Some Game Effects may grant players permission to play Units to locations that are not normally Valid . Such locations become Valid for the purposes of Playing the Unit. . 352.3. For Spells and Abilities that Move one or more Units , choose a valid Location as the Move Destination for each Move that will be performed. 352.4. If a card requires you to specifically choose one or more Game Objects , that choice is made now. 352.4.a. This does not include cards that affect one or more Game Objects based on criteria. Example: &quot;Stun a unit at a battlefield&quot; is a Choice. Example: &quot;Kill all gear&quot; is not a Choice. 352.4.b. This does not include making choices for Triggered Abilities of permanents, even if those abilities trigger when the permanent is played. Example: A unit with a triggered ability that says &quot;When I&#x27;m played, kill a unit&quot; does not require you to choose a target as it&#x27;s played. The target will be chosen when the ability triggers. See rule 375. Triggered Abilities for more information. 352.5. Targeting 352.6. When a card Chooses one or more specific Game Objects to affect, it is Targeted. 352.7. In order to put a spell or ability on the chain, valid choices must be made for all targets. 352.8. A target is a valid choice if it meets all of the following requirements: 352.8.a. It is a permanent or rune on the board, a spell or ability on the chain, a player or zone, or specified explicitly or implicitly as being in some other zone. e.g., &quot;Kill a unit&quot; targets a unit on the board. e.g., &quot;Recycle a unit from your trash&quot; targets a unit card in your trash. 352.8.a.1. &quot;Unit,&quot; &quot;gear,&quot; and &quot;rune&quot; refer to objects on the Board unless specified otherwise. 352.8.a.2. &quot;Spell&quot; and &quot;ability&quot; refer to objects on the Chain unless specified otherwise. 352.8.a.3. &quot;Facedown card&quot; refers to a card in a Facedown Zone unless specified otherwise. 352.8.a.4. &quot;Legend&quot; refers to a legend in the Legend Zone. 352.8.a.5. &quot;Chosen Champion&quot; and &quot;unit in the Champion Zone&quot; refer to a unit in the Champion Zone unless specified otherwise. 352.8.b. It meets all targeting restrictions. e.g., A unit is a valid target for a spell that refers to a &quot;unit at a battlefield,&quot; &quot;enemy unit,&quot; &quot;unit you control,&quot; or &quot;unit with Might 4 or greater&quot; only if it meets the appropriate criteria. 352.8.c. It is not the spell or ability itself. e.g., A spell that says &quot;Counter a spell&quot; cannot target itself. e.g., An ability of a permanent can target that permanent, because abilities and their sources are separate objects. 352.9. If a spell or ability requires one or more players to choose objects, players, or zones that are not targets, those choices are made on resolution. 352.9.a. Passive abilities never have targets. 352.9.b. Replacement effects never have targets. 352.9.c. Units and gear never have targets, although their abilities may. 352.10. A game object, player, or zone mentioned in the text of a spell, activated ability, or triggered ability is a target UNLESS any of the following are true: 352.10.a. It is in a zone whose information status is not Public. e.g., &quot;Ready a legend&quot; targets a legend, because the Legend Zone is Public. e.g., &quot;Return a unit from your trash to your hand&quot; targets a unit card in your trash, because your trash is Public. e.g., &quot;You may play a unit from your hand, ignoring its costs&quot; does not target a unit card in your hand, because your hand is not a public zone. 352.10.a.1. Public zones are Battlefield Zones, Bases, Trashes, Legend Zones, Champion Zones, and Facedown Zones. 352.10.b. It is included only as part of a targeting restriction for another choice. e.g., &quot;Kill a unit at a battlefield&quot; targets a unit, but not a battlefield, because the units are targets and &quot;at a battlefield&quot; is a restriction. e.g., &quot;Kill all units at a battlefield&quot; targets a battlefield, but not any units. e.g., &quot;Move a unit to a battlefield&quot; targets both a unit and a battlefield. 352.10.c. It is included only as part of a cost, trigger condition, or replacement effect. e.g., &quot;As an additional cost to play me, kill a friendly unit&quot; doesn&#x27;t target anything. e.g., &quot;When a friendly unit dies, kill a gear&quot; targets a gear, but not a friendly unit. e.g., &quot;When you play me, the next time a friendly unit would die this turn, return it to your hand instead&quot; doesn&#x27;t target anything. The replacement effect applies when any friendly unit dies. e.g., &quot;Choose a friendly unit. The next time it would die this turn, return it to your hand instead&quot; targets a friendly unit, because &quot;choose a friendly unit&quot; is not part of the replacement effect. 352.10.c.1. This includes costs within instructions, identified by phrases like &quot;[do X] to [do Y].&quot; The cost within that instruction is &quot;[do X].&quot; e.g., &quot;When I hold, you may kill another friendly unit here to draw 1&quot; does not target anything. e.g., &quot;When you play me, you may spend a buff to move a friendly unit&quot; targets the friendly unit, but not the buff. 352.10.d. It is programmatically selected based on its characteristics rather than chosen by the spell or ability&#x27;s controller. e.g., &quot;Kill all units at a battlefield&quot; targets a battlefield, but does not target any units. e.g., &quot;Kill all units at battlefields&quot; doesn&#x27;t target anything. e.g., &quot;Destroy a unit. Its controller draws 2 cards&quot; targets the unit, but not its controller. e.g., &quot;Ready your legend&quot; doesn&#x27;t target anything, because you can only have one legend. e.g., &quot;Ready a friendly legend&quot; targets a legend, because in a 2v2 game there are two friendly legends. e.g., &quot;Recycle all cards in your trash&quot; doesn&#x27;t target anything, because it affects all cards and you only have one trash. 352.10.d.1. This exception applies solely to objects for which no choice is ever possible. 352.10.d.2. This exception does not apply to objects that are the only valid choice at the moment a spell or ability is placed on the chain, but which would require a choice under other circumstances. e.g., &quot;Kill a unit at a battlefield&quot; always targets a unit, even if that unit is the only unit currently at a battlefield. 352.10.e. It is part of a set of objects chosen in whole or in part by other players. e.g., &quot;Each player kills a unit they control&quot; does not target. Each player, including the one who played the spell, chooses a unit to kill as the spell or ability resolves. 352.10.f. It is identified in an instruction that a player &quot;must&quot; complete. e.g., &quot;You must recycle one of your runes&quot; doesn&#x27;t target anything. You choose from among your runes as the spell or ability resolves. e.g., &quot;Recycle a rune you control&quot; targets a rune. You choose a rune you control as you put the spell or ability on the chain. 352.11. Some cards identify a group of Targets with Targeting Requirements that must be met by the group as a whole. 352.11.a. As they&#x27;re finalized on the chain, such cards can choose any group of valid targets that collectively fulfill the targeting restriction. 352.11.b. If the group of targets no longer collectively fulfill the targeting restriction as the spell or ability resolves, that spell or ability&#x27;s controller can choose a subset of the original targets that fulfills the targeting requirement for the spell or ability to affect. Example: A player plays FoxFire, a spell that says in part &quot;Kill any number of units at a battlefield with total Might 4 or less.&quot; That player chooses four 1 [M] Recruit tokens at a single battlefield. As a Reaction, another player gives two of those Recruits +1 [M], so the Recruits&#x27; Mights are 1, 1, 2, and 2. Then FoxFire resolves. The Recruits no longer have total Might 4 or less, so FoxFire&#x27;s controller must choose a legal subset of the original targets to affect. They could choose to kill the two 2 [M] Recruits, or the two 1 [M] Recruits plus one 2 [M] Recruit. The units they choose are FoxFire&#x27;s remaining legal targets. They can&#x27;t choose to affect units at the same battlefield that weren&#x27;t initially chosen as targets, and they can&#x27;t affect any units that are no longer at the chosen battlefield. 352.12. If a card specifies that a player may choose some number of Game Objects to be affected by a card, then all choices are considered targeted and chosen independently. 352.13. If a card specifies that a player chooses &quot;any number&quot; or &quot;up to&quot; some number of Game Objects to be affected, they may choose any number of available targets, including zero. If they choose zero, the spell or ability can be played without any targets. 352.14. Splitting 352.14.a. If a card specifies that an amount of damage may be split among some number of Units , then each Unit chosen is Targeted. 352.14.b. The Targets are chosen when the spell or ability is finalized on the chain. 352.14.c. A number of Targets can only be chosen up to, and not exceeding, the initial amount of damage available when the spell is played. Example: A player playing a spell that instructs them to &quot;Split 5 damage&quot; may only choose up to 5 units, but may choose fewer. 352.14.d. Each Target is valid, and contributes to Chosen triggers individually. 352.14.e. The choice of how much damage is divided across the split is not decided until the resolution of the spell or ability. 352.14.f. Each Target must receive a valid amount of damage. 352.14.g. Valid damage is a positive integer amount, greater than or equal to 1 damage. 352.14.h. If, at resolution of the spell or effect, there are more Targets than available damage to divide, then the player who controls the effect dealing damage determines which Targets cease being Targets. 352.14.i. Any costs that were paid, or effects that were triggered as a result of those Game Objects being chosen as Targets remain in effect, paid, or otherwise triggered. 352.15. These choices cannot be changed after this step. 352.16. A player may not make choices during this step that will deterministically result in illegal choices or actions later in this process unless they have no choice. Example: A player plays Cruel Patron, which says &quot;As an additional cost to play me, kill a friendly unit.&quot; They control exactly one unit, which is at a battlefield. They can&#x27;t choose to play Cruel Patron to that battlefield, because by the time they have finished paying costs, they will no longer control that battlefield. 353. 3. Determine Total Cost. 353.1. If an ability or instruction allows you to &quot;ignore&quot; one or more of a card&#x27;s costs, set the appropriate Base Cost(s) of the card to zero. 353.1.a. If a card allows a player to play a card &quot;ignoring its cost,&quot; its base Energy cost and base Power cost are set to zero. 353.1.b. If a card instructs a player to play a card &quot;ignoring its Energy cost&quot; or &quot;ignoring its Power cost,&quot; only the appropriate cost is set to zero, and the remaining cost still applies. 353.1.c. Further additional costs and/or cost increases applied in subsequent steps may raise the card&#x27;s Total Cost above zero. Example: Legion Rearguard is a Fury unit that costs 2 Energy and 0 Power and has Accelerate. A player plays Legion Rearguard and is instructed to ignore its costs, but chooses to pay the Accelerate cost. They ignore Legion Rearguard&#x27;s Base Cost of 2 Energy, but the optional additional cost of 1 Energy and 1 Fury Power is added to its Total Cost and must be paid. 353.2. Apply additional costs in any order. 353.2.a. Mandatory Additional Costs 353.2.a.1. Some Additional Costs specified by Passive Abilities on the card being played or another card are Mandatory , and must be paid to complete playing the card. They use the phrase &quot;as an additional cost&quot; and don&#x27;t include the word &quot;may.&quot; Example: A unit has the passive ability &quot;As an additional cost to play me, kill a friendly unit.&quot; To play that unit, a player must kill a friendly unit. See rule 360. Passive Abilities for more information. 353.2.a.2. The cost imposed by the Deflect keyword is a Mandatory Additional Cost. See rule 735. Deflect for more information. 353.2.b. Optional Additional Costs 353.2.b.1. Some Optional Costs specified by Passive Abilities on the card being played or another card are NonMandatory , and must be paid only if the player made the choice to pay them in rule 352. They use the phrase &quot;as an additional cost&quot; and the word &quot;may.&quot; Example: A unit has the ability &quot;As you play me, you may discard 1 as an additional cost. If you do, reduce my cost by [2].&quot; While playing the unit, its controller declares their intention to pay the additional cost in rule 352 , applies that additional cost in rule 353.2 , applies the discount granted by paying that cost in rule 353.4 , and discards a card to pay that additional cost in rule 354.2. See rule 360. Passive Abilities for more information. 353.3. Apply cost increases. 353.4. Apply discounts in any order. 353.4.a. Discounts may be applied by the card being played or by any other card or effect. 353.4.b. Discounts may say that cards &quot;cost [amount] less&quot; or that one or more of their costs are &quot;reduced by [amount].&quot; 353.4.c. If a discount applies a minimum cost, that minimum applies only to that discount. Example: Eager Apprentice says &quot;While I&#x27;m at a battlefield, the Energy costs for spells you play is reduced by [1], to a minimum of [1].&quot; A player who controls Eager Apprentice and a unit with 7 Might plays Sky Splitter, a spell that costs 8 Energy and says &quot;This spell&#x27;s Energy cost is reduced by the highest Might among units you control.&quot; That player can choose to apply Eager Apprentice&#x27;s discount first, reducing Sky Splitter&#x27;s Energy cost to 7, then apply Sky Splitter&#x27;s discount, reducing its Energy cost to 0. If they applied these discounts in the other order, Sky Splitter&#x27;s Energy cost would be 1. 353.4.d. Discounts can reduce additional costs, including to 0. 353.4.d.1. An optional additional cost was &quot;paid&quot; if the player made the decision in rule 352 to pay it. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much the player actually paid. Example: Clockwork Keeper is a unit that costs 2 Energy and 0 Power and says &quot;As you play me, you may pay [C] as an additional cost. If you do, draw &quot; A player controls a card that says &quot;Units you play cost [A] less.&quot; That player plays Clockwork Keeper and chooses to pay the optional additional cost of [C]. They will draw a card, even though the optional additional cost was reduced to 0. 353.5. Energy and Power costs can&#x27;t be reduced below 0. 353.6. Costs may be Energy costs, Power costs, or nonstandard costs. Example: A card reads &quot;As an additional cost to play me, kill a friendly unit.&quot; Killing a friendly unit is an additional cost to play that card. 354. 4. Pay the card&#x27;s costs. 354.1. In total, pay the combined Energy cost (if any) and Power cost (if any). 354.1.a. During this step, the spell&#x27;s controller can use activated abilities with the Reaction tag that Add resources to add Energy and Power to pay the spell&#x27;s costs. See rule 161. Rune Pools and rule 416. Add for more information. 354.2. In addition, pay any nonstandard Cost summed in rule 353.2 in any order. 354.2.a. Costs that are replaced with other events by replacement effects are still considered paid. Example: A player plays Cruel Patron, which says &quot;As an additional cost to play me, kill a friendly unit.&quot; They also control Zhonya&#x27;s Hourglass, which says &quot;If a friendly unit would die, kill this instead. Heal that unit, exhaust it, and recall it.&quot; They choose to kill a friendly unit during rule 353.2 , but as they pay the cost in rule 354.2 , Zhonya&#x27;s Hourglass replaces that unit&#x27;s death. The cost is considered paid, and the player can continue playing Cruel Patron. 354.3. A player may not pay costs during this step that will deterministically result in illegal choices or actions later in this process unless they have no choice. Example: A player plays Cruel Patron, which says &quot;As an additional cost to play me, kill a friendly unit.&quot; They control multiple units, one of which is alone at a battlefield. During rule 352.2. , they chose to play Cruel Patron to that battlefield. While paying costs, they can&#x27;t choose to kill the unit at that battlefield, because then they will no longer control that battlefield and Cruel Patron cannot legally be played there. If they controlled that battlefield with multiple units, any of those units would be a legal choice, because they would still control the battlefield after killing one. 355. 5. Check legality. 355.1. Check that all chosen targets are legal. 355.2. Ensure that the outcome of the effect of this card being played would not create an illegal state. Example: Check that a spell&#x27;s execution does not create a state where a Battlefield has Units controlled by 3 different players. 355.3. If the card, if continued to be played, would create an illegal state, or if a choice or action at this state is illegal, the actions taken in this process are undone and the action is cancelled. 356. 6. Finalize this card and proceed with the card&#x27;s category of Play. 356.1. This card is no longer Pending . 356.2. A Permanent leaves the Chain and becomes a Game Object. 356.2.a. Any passive abilities become active. 356.2.b. Execute all rules text on the card, from top to bottom. 356.2.c. If it is a Unit , it enters the Board exhausted at the Location that was chosen. 356.2.d. If it is a Gear, it enters the Board Ready at the player&#x27;s Base. 356.3. A Spell lingers on the Chain. 356.3.a. This card becomes a Finalized Chain Item. 356.3.b. If there are other Pending Items on the Chain, then the controller of those Pending Items completes Steps 2 through 5 of Playing Cards for those items before continuing. See rule 326. Chains for more information . 356.3.c. Other players have an opportunity to play Reactions before the resolution of spells. See rule 326. Chains for more information. 356.3.d. Otherwise, execute the game effect of the spell, from top to bottom of the rules text of the card and then place the card in the Trash of the owning player. 356.3.e. Handling illegal and impossible instructions 356.3.e.1. The spell resolves even if some or all of its targets are illegal. 356.3.e.2. A target is illegal as the spell resolves if it no longer meets the targeting requirements of the spell, or if it has changed Zones to or from a NonBoard Zone. 356.3.e.3. If a target ceases to meet the targeting requirements while the spell is on the chain, then meets them again, it&#x27;s a legal target. Example: A spell targets &quot;a unit at a battlefield.&quot; A player reacts with a spell that moves the unit to base, then another player reacts with a spell that moves it back to that battlefield, then the original spell resolves. The unit is a legal target. 356.3.e.4. If a target changes Zones to or from a NonBoard Zone and then returns to its original zone, it is no longer a legal target, because it&#x27;s not treated as the same object. Examples: An enemy unit at a battlefield is no longer a legal target if it is no longer an enemy, no longer a unit, or no longer at a battlefield. A unit with 3 or less Might is no longer a legal target if it is no longer a unit or if its Might is greater than 3. Something that&#x27;s exhausted is no longer a legal target if it is no longer exhausted. (It can&#x27;t stop being &quot;something.&quot;) A spell that&#x27;s played from hidden can normally only target its own battlefield or something at that battlefield. A target for such a spell may cease to be a legal target if it moves from the battlefield where that spell was played, even if the spell has no location targeting requirement otherwise. 356.3.e.5. If any of the spell&#x27;s targets are no longer legal, those targets are unaffected by the spell as it resolves. Example: A player plays Void Seeker, a spell that says &quot;Deal 4 to a unit at a battlefield. Draw 1.&quot; The unit&#x27;s controller uses a Reaction to move the unit to their base. Since the unit is no longer a legal target, it is not dealt any damage. Void Seeker&#x27;s controller still draws 1. 356.3.e.6. Instructions that can&#x27;t be followed, either because of illegal targets or other circumstances, are ignored. 356.3.e.7. If all of an instruction&#x27;s Targets become Invalid or Unavailable by the time the spell is finished being played, that instruction will not execute. 356.3.e.8. If an instruction has more than one Target and fewer than all of the Targets become Invalid or Unavailable by the time the spell is finished being played, the instruction will execute, with only the Targets available and valid being operated on. 356.3.e.9. The process for a card&#x27;s choice becoming Invalid or Unavailable is referred to as mistargeting. Example: A spell has the instruction &quot;Deal 2 to a unit at a battlefield.&quot; Before that instruction can execute, the chosen unit is moved to its base. The instruction will not be executed, because it specifies that the unit it chooses must be at a Battlefield, and by the time it attempted to execute, the unit was no longer valid as a choice. 356.3.e.10. It is possible for none of a spell&#x27;s instructions to be executed as it resolves, due to all of them requiring targets to act on and all of those targets becoming Invalid or Unavailable . In this case, the spell has no effect but is still considered played. Example: A player plays a spell that reads &quot;Deal 2 to a unit at a battlefield&quot; with no other instructions, and chooses an enemy unit at a battlefield. They also control a unit with the ability &quot;When you play a spell, give me +1 [M] this turn.&quot; Before the spell resolves, the chosen unit is moved to its base. The spell resolves and its only instruction cannot be executed, but the unit&#x27;s ability still triggers as the spell resolves and gives it +1 [M]. 356.3.e.11. Instructions that can be partially followed are followed as much as possible and ignored otherwise. Example: A player plays a spell that says &quot;Discard 2, then draw 2&quot; If their hand is empty, the instruction to discard 2 will be ignored. They&#x27;ll still draw 2. If they had 1 card in hand, they would discard it and draw 2. 356.3.e.12. If the spell checks information about a target that is no longer legal or a card or permanent whose location, zone, or status has changed such that that information is no longer available, that check returns &quot;null&quot; and all calculations based on it are ignored. Examples: A unit that is no longer on the board is treated as having null Might, null cost, etc. A unit that is no longer on the board has no location, is neither exhausted nor readied, etc. Baited Hook says &quot;[1][C], [E]: Kill a friendly unit. Look at the top 5 cards of your Main Deck. You may banish a unit from among them that has Might up to 1 more than the killed unit and play it, ignoring its cost. Then recycle the rest.&quot; While Baited Hook&#x27;s ability is on the chain, an opponent reacts with a spell that returns the friendly unit to its owner&#x27;s hand. Because the friendly unit is no longer a legal target, it can&#x27;t be killed and its Might is treated as null. Baited Hook&#x27;s controller reveals the top 5 cards of their Main Deck, but can&#x27;t choose any unit from among them. 356.3.e.13. A spell or ability that moves something to a different zone as a cost or effect can &quot;look back&quot; at its characteristics before it changes zones. 357. Abilities 358. An Ability is the structured rules and capabilities of Game Objects or Spells. 358.1. An Ability has multiple structures. Passive Abilities Replacement Effects Activated Abilities Triggered Abilities Delayed Abilities 359. A card can have more than one Ability and more than one type of Ability. 360. Passive Abilities 361. Conditions, rules, constraints, or statements that affect the course of regular play. 361.1. These abilities have a wide variety of formats to recognize. Example: &quot;I get +1[M] while you have 2 or more cards in your hand.&quot; Example: &quot;Friendly Yordles at my battlefield have [Shield].&quot; 361.2. They can be recognized by being statements of fact. 361.3. Passive Abilities can be conditional. 361.3.a. Conditional Passive Abilities can be recognized by the occurrence of &quot;if&quot; or &quot;while&quot; as part of the statement of the ability. Example: &quot; While I&#x27;m attacking or defending alone, I have +2 [M].&quot; Example: &quot; If an opponent controls a battlefield, I enter ready.&quot; 362. Presence on Permanents 362.1. Passive Abilities of Permanents are typically only active while on the Board. 363. Presence on Card outside of the Board 363.1. Passive Abilities of cards in zones that are outside of the Board will selfdescribe their context. Example: The passive ability &quot;Play me only during an opponent&#x27;s turn.&quot; applies in any zone from which that card can be played. 363.2. Passive Abilities can alter the costs of cards as they are played. 363.2.a. These apply at all times in any zone from which the card with the ability can be played. 364. Replacement Effects 365. An ability that alters the application of another game effect or game rule. 365.1. Passive Abilities can be Replacement Effects. 366. Replacement Effects intercede during the execution of a Game Effect and alter its execution. 366.1. A Replacement Effect can be identified by the presence of the term &quot;instead.&quot; Example: Zhonya&#x27;s Hourglass reads &quot;The next time a friendly unit would die, kill this instead. Recall that unit exhausted.&quot; This is a replacement effect that alters the execution of any Game Effect that would kill a friendly unit. 367. A Replacement Effect can alter the typical flow of play, including other cards&#x27; executions. 368. If more than one Replacement Effect applies to the same event being executed, then the owner of the object being acted on determines the order the Replacement Effects will apply. 368.1. If it is a player being acted on, that player decides the order the Replacement Effects will apply. 368.2. If the affected object is an Uncontrolled Battlefield then the Current Turn Player decides the order the Replacement Effects will apply. 369. Activated Abilities 370. Activated Abilities are repeatable effects with a cost. They follow a process of going onto the chain and resolving, similar to Playing a Card. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information. 370.1. Activated Abilities are recognized by the presence of a &quot;:&quot; in the text of the card, preceded by a cost and succeeded by an effect. Example: &quot;[2]: Draw 1&quot; is an activated ability. The cost is 2 energy. The effect is to draw 1 card. 370.2. Activated Abilities use the chain. 370.2.a. Declare activation of the Ability. 370.2.a.1. The ability goes on the chain but has no card to represent it, so players need to take note that it is now a Closed State. 370.2.b. Proceed with executing the Chain. 370.2.b.1. Follow the steps of &quot;Playing or Activating Abilities&quot; in rule 386 . This ability will become a Pending Chain Item. 370.2.b.2. Opponents have an opportunity to respond, as appropriate, as if a card was played onto the chain. 370.2.b.3. If no further action is taken, execute the Activated Ability. 371. The controlling player chooses when and whether to activate an Activated Ability. 372. Activated abilities are present on Game Objects and some Spells. 373. Can primarily be activated while on the Board. 374. All Activated Abilities can only be activated on the Controlling Player&#x27;s Turn and during an Open State. 375. Triggered Abilities 376. Triggered Abilities are repeatable effects that happen when a Condition is met. 376.1. Triggered Abilities can usually be recognized by the word &quot;when&quot; followed by a game action or event; the word &quot;at&quot; followed by a point in time during the turn sequence; or the phrase &quot;the [Nth] time&quot; followed by a game action or event. Examples: &quot; When you conquer here, you may spend a buff to draw 1.&quot; &quot;At the end of your turn, ready 2 runes.&quot; &quot;The first time I move each turn, you may ready something else that&#x27;s exhausted.&quot; 376.1.a. The phrases that identify triggered abilities do not always appear at the beginning of sentences or abilities. 376.1.b. If an ability triggers &quot;the [Nth] time&quot; something happens and that trigger condition is met multiple times simultaneously, the ability&#x27;s controller picks one of those instances to serve as the trigger condition. The ability triggers only once, due to the chosen condition. Example: Wraith of Echoes reads &quot;The first time another friendly unit dies each turn, draw 1.&quot; That ability hasn&#x27;t triggered yet this turn. Two other friendly units die simultaneously (say, due to combat damage). The Wraith&#x27;s controller chooses one of those deaths to trigger Wraith&#x27;s ability. 376.2. Triggered Abilities have a Condition and an Effect. 376.2.a. The Condition follows the When. 376.2.b. The Effect is the Instruction that follows the comma after the Condition. 376.2.c. The Condition of a Trigger is evaluated after a potentially inciting event has been processed. 376.2.c.1. If a Game Object with a Triggered Ability that is active in a specific zone, it is evaluated and subsequently triggered if it enters that zone at the same time that its Trigger &#x27;s condition is met. Example: Immortal Phoenix says &quot;When you kill a unit with a spell, you may pay [1][C] to play me from your trash.&quot; This ability triggers if Immortal Phoenix is in your trash immediately after you kill a unit with a spell, even if the unit you killed with a spell was that Immortal Phoenix. 376.2.c.2. A Game Object will not be able to successfully be able to evaluate its Trigger Condition , however, if it leaves the zone that its Trigger is active from at the same time that its Trigger is satisfied. Example: Viktor, Leader says &quot;When another nonRecruit unit you control dies, play a 1 [M] Recruit unit token into your base.&quot; This ability triggers if Viktor is on the board immediately after another nonRecruit unit you control dies. It does not trigger if Viktor and another nonRecruit unit you control die during the same game action (for instance, if they are both killed in the same Cleanup due to the damage dealt by Unchecked Power). 376.3. When a Condition is met, a Triggered Ability behaves like an Activated Ability and is placed on the Chain. 376.3.a. Triggered Abilities can be put on the Chain during Closed States or Open States on any player&#x27;s turn. 376.3.b. If more than one Triggered Ability is Triggered simultaneously, then the player that controls the Abilities selects the order to place them on the Chain. 376.3.b.1. If multiple players separately control Triggered Abilities that are Triggered simultaneously, then starting with the Turn Player and proceeding in Turn Order , each player orders their Triggered Abilities on the Chain. 376.4. Some Conditions are commonly used and structured in a way that explicitly defines their use and other properties of the Effect that is associated with it. 376.4.a. Play Effects are Triggered Abilities with the Condition that the Permanent that has the Play Effect being played to the board. 376.4.a.1. These are commonly structured as &quot;When you play me…&quot; for Units and &quot;When you play this…&quot; for Gear. 376.4.a.2. These Triggered Abilities are put on the Chain as Pending Items after the Permanent these effects correspond to is finalized and enters the board. 376.4.a.3. These Triggered Abilities can be referred to as Play Effects. 376.4.a.4. Abilities that trigger when another object is played are not considered Play Effects. 376.4.b. Conquer Effects are Triggered Abilities with a Condition of a Unit participating in, and successfully Conquering a Battlefield. 376.4.b.1. These are commonly structured as &quot;When I conquer…&quot; and &quot;When you conquer…&quot; 376.4.b.2. This category of Triggered Abilities encompasses only those that are triggered from Units that were present during the Conquer action, or Abilities that reference the player that performed the Conquer action. 376.4.b.2.a. The Conquer Abilities of Units are put on the Chain as Pending Items after the Unit(s) these effects correspond to are present at a Battlefield when a player gains control of it and gains 1 Victory Point from Conquering. 376.4.b.2.b. The Conquer Abilities of anything that references the player Conquering is put on the Chain as a Pending Item when the Condition that the player that controls the triggering source has performed a Conquer and gained 1 Victory Point. 376.4.b.2.c. If the act of gaining one point from Conquering is negated or replaced in any way, the Conquer Effect will still trigger. 376.4.b.3. These Triggered Abilities can be referred to as Conquer Effects. 376.4.c. Hold Effects are Triggered Abilities with a Condition of a Unit being present at a Battlefield during the Beginning phase when a player scores Victory Points from Holding. 376.4.c.1. These are commonly structured as &quot;When I hold…&quot; or &quot;When you hold…&quot; 376.4.c.2. This category of Triggered Abilities encompasses only those that are triggered from Units that were present during the Hold action, or Abilities that reference the player that performed the Hold action. 376.4.c.2.a. The Hold Abilities of Units are put on the Chain as Pending Items after the Unit these effects correspond to are present at a Battlefield when a player maintains control of it and Gains 1 Victory Point during their Beginning Phase from Holding. 376.4.c.2.b. The Hold Abilities of anything that references the player Holding is put on the Chain as a Pending Item when the Condition that the player that controls the triggering source has performed a Hold and gained 1 Victory Point. 376.4.c.2.c. If the act of gaining one point from Holding is negated or replaced in any way, the Hold Effect will still trigger. 376.4.c.3. These Triggered Abilities can be referred to as Hold Effects. 376.4.d. Attack Triggers are Triggered Abilities that trigger when a Unit gains the Attacker designation for the first time during a combat. 376.4.d.1. These are commonly structured as &quot;When I attack…&quot; 376.4.d.2. These Triggered Abilities are put on the Chain as Pending Items after the Unit these effects correspond to gains the Attacker designation during Combat . 376.4.d.2.a. These triggers can only become fulfilled once per combat, despite a Unit being able to gain and lose the Attacker designation multiple times in the same combat. 376.4.d.3. These Triggered Abilities can be referred to as Attack Triggers. 376.4.e. Defend Triggers are Triggered Abilities that trigger when a Unit gains the Defender designation for the first time during a combat. 376.4.e.1. These are commonly structured as &quot;When I defend…&quot; 376.4.e.2. These Triggered Abilities are put on the Chain as Pending Items after the Unit these effects correspond to gains the Defender designation during Combat . 376.4.e.2.a. These triggers can only become fulfilled once per combat, despite a Unit being able to gain and lose the Defender designation multiple times in the same combat. 376.4.e.3. These Triggered Abilities can be referred to as Defend Triggers. 377. Presence on Permanents 377.1. Typically active while on the Board. 377.2. Triggered Abilities of Permanents are only able to have their Conditions evaluated while on the Board. 378. Presence on Cards outside of the Board 378.1. Triggered Abilities on cards outside of the Board rely on the Information Level of the zone they are in. 378.2. Triggered Abilities outside of the Board will selfdescribe their context. Example: The triggered ability &quot;When you conquer, you may discard 1 to return this from your trash to your hand.&quot; triggers while the card it&#x27;s on is in the trash, and not anywhere else. 379. Reflexive Triggers 380. Reflexive Triggers are a type of Triggered Ability that create one or more Chain Items when their condition is met. 380.1. Reflexive Triggers can be recognized by the phrase &quot;Do this:&quot; or &quot;Do one of the following:&quot;. 380.1.a. &quot;Do this&quot; can be followed by &quot;N times.&quot; The Reflexive Trigger will thus be added to the chain N times when its condition is met. 380.2. Reflexive Triggers will be preceded by their conditions, if any. If no condition is present in the ability then the Reflexive Trigger will always be added to the Chain. 380.3. If present, the Condition of a Reflexive Trigger will follow the same format as a Triggered Ability. 381. Reflexive Triggers use the Chain. 381.1. A new ability is created and added to the chain as a Pending Item . See rule 386. Playing or Activating Abilities for more information. 381.2. If a Reflexive Trigger creates more than one Pending Item it creates them all in order, but does not go beyond the first step of adding them to the Chain. See rule 386. Playing or Activating Abilities for more information. 382. Delayed Abilities 383. Delayed Abilities are a type of Ability whose trigger Condition identifies a specific time during a turn or a specific event that can occur during a specific timeframe. 383.1. Delayed Abilities can be any other type of Ability , and contain all of the properties of that type in addition to the properties of Delayed Abilities. 383.2. Delayed Triggers are Triggered Abilities that can be recognized by describing a specific time of the turn, or by structuring a Triggered Ability with a specific frame of time as a restriction. 383.3. Delayed Replacements are Replacement Effects that can be recognized by specifying the effect they are replacing at a specific time, or &quot;the [Nth] time&quot; in the description of the effect as it resolves. 383.4. Delayed Passive Abilities are Passive Abilities that are applicable only during a specified window of time. The time that the Delayed Passive Ability applies will be recognized in the effect that initiates it. 384. Delayed Abilities will resolve or be active just like the ability they augment, but only during the specified time in the effect that created the Delayed Ability. Example: Ravenborn Tome reads &quot;The next spell you play this turn deals 1 Bonus Damage&quot; is a Delayed Passive Ability that passively adds 1 damage to just the next spell played. The next spell is a specific time, and the 1 Bonus Damage is a passive ability. Example: Noxian Guillotine reads &quot;Choose a unit. Kill it the next time it takes damage this turn.&quot; When the chosen unit takes damage is the specified time, and killing it is the condition for a Delayed Triggered Ability. 385. Delayed Abilities are not associated with Units or Gear; they are created by other Abilities or Spells . As such they are executed when their condition and/or specified time occurs regardless of whether the source of the Delayed Ability is still on the board or not. 386. Playing or Activating Abilities 387. Playing or activating Abilities follows the same steps of playing cards. 388. Abilities when added to the Chain become Pending Items until they complete the steps of Playing. 388.1. When an Ability finishes the steps of playing it becomes a Chain Item just like a Spell. 388.2. When an Ability with the [Add] action is finalized it resolves immediately instead of becoming a Chain Item , like a Unit or Gear. 389. 1. Activate or trigger the Ability 389.1. Add a Pending Item to the chain representing the Ability that is either being Activated or Triggered. Notably, although this Chain Item will not have a card representing it, this will create a Closed State. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information. 389.2. If there is currently a game effect being resolved, continue resolving the game effect instead of continuing the following steps. 390. 2. Make relevant choices 390.1. Make all choices required for this ability, such as targets, options, or other relevant decisions. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information 390.2. If legal options are not available for an Activated Ability, it is not legal to activate it. 390.3. If there are not enough options to make legal choices for a Triggered Ability that has been put on the chain, remove it from the Chain now. It ceases to be a Pending Item but never becomes a Chain Item. 390.3.a. This is not an Ability being countered. 390.3.b. If there are legal options to choose, the ability&#x27;s controller must choose them. They may not decline this stage of playing a Trigger. 391. 3. Determine Total Cost 391.1. Determine the base cost of the Ability. 391.1.a. Activated Abilities will have a cost listed before the &quot;:&quot; in their text. 391.1.b. Triggered Abilities will typically not have a base cost associated with them when placed on the chain due to their conditions. 391.2. Apply cost increases and decreases as a result of choices made in the prior step. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information. 391.3. Apply any other cost increases or decreases as necessary. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information. 392. 4. Pay Costs 392.1. Pay costs as determined in the prior step. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information. 392.2. At this stage, players may decline to pay for Triggered Abilities that have incurred a cost. If they do, the ability will cease being a Pending Item and be removed from the Chain. It never becomes a Chain Item. 392.2.a. This is not an Ability being countered. 393. 5. Check Legality 393.1. Ensure that the Ability&#x27;s targets are still legal. 393.2. Ensure that the Ability &#x27;s effect would not create an illegal state. If it would, resolve in the same way you would resolve a Card that creates an illegal state. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information. 394. 6. Proceed with Play 394.1. This Ability is no longer Pending. 394.2. This Ability becomes a Chain Item. 394.3. If there are other Pending Items on the Chain, their controllers perform the remaining steps of playing now. 394.4. Other players have an opportunity to play Reactions before the resolution of spells. See rule 326. Chains for more information. 394.5. Otherwise, execute the Ability just like a Spell , then clear the Chain Item from the Chain. 395. Game Actions 396. Game Actions are actions players may perform at any given time during the game. 397. A player, unless otherwise specified or prompted, may only perform actions on their turn. 398. There are two types of Game Actions: 398.1. Discretionary Actions 398.1.a. A Discretionary Action is a Game Action that may be performed at any time during a player&#x27;s turn during a Neutral Open State. See rule 307. States of the Turn for more information. 398.1.b. A player may take any number of Discretionary Actions available to them during their turn. 398.1.b.1. As long as any conditions, if applicable, are met. 398.1.b.2. As long as any costs, if applicable, are paid. 398.1.b.3. As long as it does not result in any forbidden action being taken or game state being created. Example: A player can&#x27;t use the Standard Move discretionary action to move a unit to a Battlefield that&#x27;s already occupied by Units controlled by two other players. 398.2. Limited Actions 398.2.a. A Limited Action is a game action that a spell, ability, or circumstance of the turn&#x27;s progression causes the player to perform. A player cannot perform these actions atwill. 398.2.b. These actions can only be taken when a player is instructed to do so as the execution of an effect or during their specified occasion during the turn. Example: A player may Draw during the Draw Step of the Beginning Phase of their turn or when instructed to do so by a spell or ability. They can&#x27;t choose to Draw at any other time. 399. Types of Actions 400. Draw 400.1. Drawing a card takes a single card from the top of the Main Deck and adds it to the player&#x27;s Hand. 400.2. This is a Limited Action. 400.2.a. Each player draws 1 during the Draw Step of their Beginning Phase. 400.2.b. The player may draw cards when instructed to do so by other game effects. 400.3. This action, when instructed, is formatted as &quot;Draw X.&quot; 400.4. If a player attempts to draw more cards than are available in their Main Deck , they do the following: 400.4.a. Draw as many as possible. 400.4.b. Perform a Burn Out. See rule 418. Burn Out for more information. 400.4.c. Draw the remaining cards needed to complete the Draw action. 401. Exhaust 401.1. Exhausting is an action that marks a nonspell Game Object as &quot;spent.&quot; 401.1.a. To mark it, rotate the card 90 degrees opposite of Readying , so that the orientation of the card is lengthwise in front of you. 401.1.b. A Unit that is already Exhausted cannot be Exhausted again. 401.1.c. If a Unit is instructed to be Exhausted while it is already Exhausted , nothing additional happens. 401.2. &quot;Exhausted&quot; is a state for Game Objects that other game effects and rules can reference. 401.3. This is a Limited Action. 401.3.a. Most Exhaust actions will be costs for Activated Abilities or Discretionary Actions. Example: A unit&#x27;s Standard Move exhausts the unit as a cost. 401.4. When Exhausting is listed as a Cost , then the Action must be able to be completed for the cost to be paid. Example: A spell says &quot;As an additional cost to play this, you may exhaust a friendly unit.&quot; An exhausted friendly unit may not be exhausted again as the additional cost for the spell, and the additional cost has not been paid. 401.5. In abilities, the Exhaust symbol represents the cost &quot;Exhaust this&quot; or &quot;Exhaust me.&quot; It resembles a card turning sideways. 402. Ready 402.1. Readying is an action that marks a nonspell Game Object as available for action. 402.1.a. To mark it, rotate the card 90 degrees opposite of Exhausting , so that it is vertically oriented in front of you. 402.1.b. A Unit that is already Ready cannot be Readied again. 402.1.c. If a Unit is instructed to be Readied while it is already Ready , nothing additional happens. 402.2. &quot;Ready&quot; is a state for Game Objects that other game effects and rules can reference. 402.3. This is a Limited Action. 402.3.a. A player Readies all nonspell Game Objects they Control during the Ready Step of the Beginning Phase on their turn. 402.3.b. The player may also Ready their Game Objects when effects or spells instruct them to do so. 403. Recycle 403.1. Recycling cards is the action in which a player takes one or more cards from a specific zone and then puts it on the bottom of the corresponding deck. 403.1.a. Main Deck cards are Recycled to the Main Deck. 403.1.b. Runes are Recycled to the Rune Deck. 403.1.c. Each player Recycles cards to their own Main Deck and Rune Deck , regardless of which player is instructed to perform the Recycle action. 403.2. This is a Limited Action. 403.2.a. The player must Recycle cards from the specified zones when instructed to do so by game effects or costs. 403.3. When Recycling is listed as a Cost , the action must be able to be completed for the cost to be paid. Example: Vi, Destructive has the ability &quot;Recycle 1 from your trash: Give me +1 [M] this turn.&quot; Each time a player activates the ability, they must recycle 1 card from their trash to pay its cost. If they have no cards in their trash, they can&#x27;t activate the ability, because they can&#x27;t pay its cost. 403.4. When Recycling is part of an effect, a player must Recycle as many cards as possible from the specified zone or zones. 403.5. If 2 or more cards are Recycled to the Main Deck simultaneously, they are placed on the bottom of that deck in a random order. Example: Garbage Grabber has the ability &quot;Recycle 3 from your trash, [1], [E]: Draw &quot; To pay the cost of activating this ability, its controller chooses 3 cards from their trash and places them on the bottom of their Main Deck in a random order. 403.5.a. If 2 or more cards are Recycled to the Rune Deck simultaneously, they are placed on the bottom of that deck in the order of their owner&#x27;s choosing. 403.6. This action, when instructed, is sometimes formatted as &quot; Recycle X from [Zone].&quot; That means to take X cards of the instructed player&#x27;s choice from the relevant zone and recycle them. Example: Dr. Mundo, Expert has the ability &quot;At the start of your Beginning Phase, recycle 3 from your trash.&quot; As that ability resolves, its controller recycles 3 cards from their trash. If there are fewer than 3 cards in that player&#x27;s trash, they recycle as many as they can. 404. Deal 404.1. Spells, Units, Abilities, and other game effects may Deal Damage to units. 404.1.a. Assigning Damage during Combat Resolution is not Dealing Damage, but will cause Damage to be Dealt when assignment is complete. 404.1.b. To Deal Damage to Units, mark the specified amount of Damage on the Unit. 404.1.c. Damage is marked on each unit separately. 404.1.d. Damage can be Dealt to more than one Unit at the same time. 404.2. Only Damage can be Dealt. 404.3. Dealing Damage is a Limited Action. 404.3.a. Assigning Damage causes Damage to be dealt outside of being directed to Deal Damage. See rule 437. Combat for more information. 404.4. Dealing can have the intrinsic property of Bonus Damage. 404.5. Bonus Damage is a property granted to the action of Dealing and alters the amount of Damage distributed by this action. See rule 712. Bonus Damage for more information. 404.6. Deal actions can originate from one or more sources. 404.6.a. If a game effect does not specify a source, the game effect describing the Deal action is the source. Example: Void Seeker is a spell that reads &quot;Deal 4 to a unit at a battlefield. Draw 1.&quot; The damage that Void Seeker instructs you to deal is dealt by Void Seeker. 404.6.b. If a game effect does specify a source, then that source is what is considered the origin of the Damage for this Deal action. 404.6.b.1. Units and Spells can be the source of Damage for Deal actions. 404.6.b.2. Abilities can be the source of Damage for Deal actions. 404.6.b.2.a. When an Ability is the source of Damage for a Deal action, it is in addition to the Spell or Unit that created that Ability. Example: Iron Ballista is a gear that says &quot;[E]: Deal 2 to a unit at a battlefield.&quot; This damage is dealt both by a gear and by an ability. 404.6.b.3. When a spell or ability specifies a Unit as the source of the Damage for the Deal action, it is not in addition to the spell or ability that specified it. Example: Challenge is a spell that reads &quot;Choose a friendly unit and an enemy unit. They deal damage equal to their Mights to each other.&quot; The damage that Challenge causes to be dealt is dealt by the chosen units, not by Challenge. 404.6.c. Damage Dealt as a result of being assigned during Combat has the Units as its source. 404.6.c.1. The Damage assigned, and subsequently Dealt , to attackers has the defenders as the source and vice versa. 404.7. Deal actions can distribute Damage as part of combat actions or noncombat actions. 405. Heal 405.1. Damage being cleared from Units is Healing. 405.1.a. If Damage is cleared for any reason it is considered Healing. 405.2. More than one Unit can be Healed at the same time. 405.3. Healing is a Limited Action. 405.3.a. Players may only Heal units when game effects instruct them to, or at specific points in the turn. 406. Play 406.1. A player Plays cards by paying costs associated with that card. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information. 406.2. This is a Discretionary Action. 406.2.a. As long as a player has the resources to pay the costs associated with the card, they may play cards. 406.3. Game effects may result in cards being played as part of their resolution. 406.3.a. This treats Play as a Limited Action. 406.3.b. Treat all steps of Play as normal, except as noted by the game effect creating this Limited Play Effect. 406.3.c. If there are no eligible cards to Play when instructed to Play in this manner like this, then nothing happens and resolution continues. 406.4. Some Abilities trigger when cards are played or otherwise check whether cards have been played. 406.4.a. These abilities trigger when the act of playing the card has been completed by the resolution of the card. 406.4.b. If a game effect prevents the resolution of the cardfor example, because the card was countered the card wasn&#x27;t played and no abilities that trigger on playing cards trigger. See rule 412. Counter for more information. 407. Move 407.1. Moving is the act of a Game Object moving between two Locations on The Board. 407.2. Moving is a Limited Action. 407.2.a. Players may only move Game Objects when instructed to do so by Game Effects or costs. 407.2.b. The Standard Move inherent to Units may also cause Movement. See rule 142 for more information on the Standard Move . 407.3. The Standard Move inherent to Units is a Discretionary Action. 407.3.a. The Cost is Exhausting one or more Units. 407.3.b. The Effect is Moving those Unit. 408. Hide 408.1. Hiding a card is the act of placing a card facedown at a Battlefield you control. 408.2. Hiding is a Discretionary Action. 408.2.a. The Hidden keyword allows a player to pay a cost to Hide a card any time they have a Hidden card in their hand or Champion Zone and meet the prerequisites. See rule 737. Hidden for more information. 408.3. Cards that are facedown at Battlefields have their gameplay properties and permissions defined by the effect that put them there. Example: Cards that players Hide with the Hidden keyword can be Played for [0] on any subsequent turn as a property of the Hidden keyword. 408.4. If a facedown card would be put into a zone whose Privacy is Private or Secret , or if the game ends, its owner reveals it to all players. See rule 127. Privacy for more information. 409. Discard 409.1. Discarding a card is moving it from a player&#x27;s hand directly into their trash without activating or executing its normal rules text. 409.1.a. The player who is performing the action chooses which cards to send to their Trash , and may use Private Information to do so. 409.1.b. &quot;When I am discarded&quot; abilities or other Triggered Abilities that trigger on discarding are executed after discarding has occurred. 409.2. Discarding is a Limited Action. 409.2.a. A player must Discard cards when instructed to do so by game effects or costs. 409.3. When Discarding is listed as a Cost , then the Action must be able to be completed for the cost to be paid. Example: A card has the ability &quot;Discard 2: Deal 2 damage to a unit at a battlefield.&quot; To activate the ability, the card&#x27;s controller must have at least 2 cards in hand and must be able to discard them. 409.4. When Discarding is part of an effect, then a player must Discard as many cards as possible from their hand. If instructed to discard more cards than they have in their hand, further discard instructions are ignored. Example: Undercover Agent has the ability &quot;[Deathknell] Discard 2, then draw 2. (When I die, get the effect.)&quot; If Undercover Agent&#x27;s controller has 2 or more cards in hand, they must discard 2. If they have 1 card in hand, they discard 1, and the rest of the discard instruction is ignored. If they have no cards in hand, the entire discard instruction is ignored. Regardless of how many cards they discard, they then draw 2. 409.5. This action is formatted as &quot;Discard X.&quot; 410. Stun 410.1. Stunning is the act of selecting one or more Units on the Board and rendering them Stunned. 410.1.a. Stunned is a binary state. A Unit is Stunned or it isn&#x27;t. 410.1.a.1.

Example: Eclipse Herald has the ability &quot;When you stun an enemy unit, ready me and give me +1 [M] this turn.&quot; Its controller plays a spell that reads &quot;Stun a unit.&quot; They may choose a unit that&#x27;s already stunned, but if they do, Eclipse Herald will not trigger. 410.1.a.2. Stunned Units lose the Stunned status at the beginning of the next Ending Step. 410.1.b. A Stunned Unit does not contribute its might to damage in combat. 410.1.c. A Stunned Unit must still have damage applied to it equal to, or greater than, its full might value to be killed. 410.2. Stunning is a Limited Action. 410.2.a. Players may only Stun Units when directed to by Game Effects. 411. Reveal 411.1. Revealing is the act of presenting a card to all players from a zone that one or more players do not have access to the information of. 411.1.a. Revealed is a temporary state and is not a zone. 411.1.a.1. Other cards, including the card being revealed, can reference the act of being Revealed. 411.1.a.2. Cards remain in the zone they are being Revealed from. Example: If a card is being Revealed from the top of a player&#x27;s Main Deck , it is still the top card of that player&#x27;s Main Deck. 411.1.b. Unless otherwise described, Revealed cards do nothing else beyond become temporarily known information to all players. 411.2. Revealing is a Limited Action. 411.2.a. Players may only Reveal cards from Private or Secret zones when instructed to do so by Game Effects. 411.2.b. During the course of a game of Riftbound , a player may choose to show Private information to one or more other players. This does not count as revealing and does not trigger any effects that trigger when cards are revealed. 411.3. This action is formatted as &quot;Reveal cards from [zone].&quot; Example: &quot;Reveal 2 cards from the top of your Main Deck&quot; would be executed by taking the two cards from the top of your Main Deck, and then presenting them to all players to clearly read and understand at the table. Then, when all players have had a chance to understand the revealed information, return them to the top of the deck in the same order. 411.4. Game Effects can manipulate or modify the cards Revealed while they are Revealed 411.4.a. While cards are Revealed , those cards can be further manipulated, or accessed. They can even have their destination modified for when the Reveal ends. Example: &quot;Reveal 2 cards from the top of your Main Deck. Put one into your hand and Recycle the other&quot; would be executed by taking the top two cards from your Main Deck to the table, and once every player present has had a chance to understand them you would make the selection of one of them to add to your hand. The one you did not select would then be Recycled to the bottom of the Main Deck. 412. Counter 412.1. Countering is the act of negating the execution, activation, or otherwise playing of a card by a player. 412.1.a. A card that is Countered does nothing and is then placed in the Trash. 412.1.b.

This action is formatted as &quot; Counter [a card or ability on the chain].&quot; 413. Buff 413.1. Buffing is the action of placing a Buff counter on a Unit . See rule 701. Buffs for more information. 413.1.a. A Buff is also an object. 413.1.b. To Buff a unit, place a Buff Counter on it if it does not have one already 413.1.b.1. If the unit already has a Buff Counter on it, it does not get another one. 413.1.c. Units with Buff Counters can still be chosen for actions that Buff units, but will not be Buffed as part of the execution. Example: A spell reads &quot;Buff a unit. Then, if it was buffed this way, draw a card.&quot; It will place a buff counter on a unit that has no buff counter, and then its controller will draw a card. However, if the player chooses a unit with a buff counter on it already, then the card will not be drawn. 413.2. Buffing is a Limited Action. 413.2.a. Players may only Buff units when Game Effects direct them to do so. 413.3. This action is formatted as &quot; Buff [one or more units].&quot; e.g., &quot;Buff a unit.&quot; e.g., &quot;Buff a friendly unit.&quot; e.g., &quot;Buff two friendly units at the same battlefield.&quot; 414. Banish 414.1. Banishing is the action of placing a card from any zone to Banishment. See 107.5. Banishment for more information. 414.2. When a card is Banished it is placed directly into the Banishment zone from its origin. 414.2.a. Banish is not a subset of Kill. 414.2.b. Banish is not a subset of Discard. 414.3. Cards and effects can refer to cards that were banished by the same object. 414.3.a. Separate instances of an object or effect banishing cards do not reference other banished cards by objects of the same name or effects originating from cards of the same name. Example: A spell reads &quot;Banish the top card of your Main Deck. When you conquer this turn, draw it.&quot; This card effect allows you to draw the banished card from banishment if a condition is met. If more than one of these effects is played, each one triggers separately. Each card will be drawn separately. If the turn player passes the turn without playing the card, the card remains in banishment indefinitely. If the same player plays another copy of the same spell, banishes another card, and satisfies its condition, they could play the new banished card, but not the original banished card. 414.4. Banishing is a Limited Action. 414.4.a. Players may only Banish cards or permanents when Game Effects direct them to do so. 414.5. This action is formatted as &quot;Banish [one or more permanents or cards].&quot; e.g., &quot;Banish a card from your hand.&quot; e.g., &quot;Banish 2 cards from your trash.&quot; e.g., &quot;Look at the top 2 cards of your Main Deck. Draw one of them and banish the other.&quot; 415. Kill 415.1. Killing is the action of a Permanent going to the trash from the board. 415.1.a. This can be Active or Passive. 415.1.a.1. Active Kill is when the action is taken when instructed by a game effect or as a cost for a card or ability. 415.1.a.1.a. This is referred to as a Kill Instruction. 415.1.a.1.b. When a unit with a Deathknell is to be put in the Trash due to a Kill Instruction , it first has its Deathknell added to the chain as a Pending Item. Note the unit&#x27;s location, attributes, and other relevant information to process its Deathknell when finalized before completing this Kill Instruction . 415.1.a.2. Passive Kill is when the action is taken as a result of Lethal Damage or as a consequence for any other state. 415.2. When a permanent is killed it is placed directly in the trash from its place of origin. 415.2.a. It is only considered Killed if its origin was any zone on the board. 415.2.b. This is not a subset of Move. 415.3. Killing is a Limited Action. 415.3.a. Players may only Kill units when Game Effects direct them to do so. 415.4. Killing can also be the result of resolving a Cleanup. 415.5. Killing can be attributed to one or more Game Objects. 415.5.a. The Killed Unit or Gear is said to be Killed by that Game Object. 415.5.b. A spell or ability that contains a Kill instruction is responsible for Killing the Unit or Gear. 415.5.c. When one or more Units is killed due to a Cleanup , the spell or ability that resolved immediately prior to that Cleanup that applied damage to the Unit or Units is responsible for that Kill action. 415.5.d. Abilities originating from Game Objects that are responsible for Kill Actions are responsible in addition to the Game Object that created them. Example: Falling Star is a spell that says &quot;Do this twice: Deal 3 to a unit.&quot; Immortal Phoenix is a unit that says &quot;When you kill a unit with a spell, you may pay [1][C] to play me from your trash.&quot; A player plays Falling Star while Immortal Phoenix is in their trash. The &quot;do this&quot; phrasing on Falling Star means that it has a reflexive triggered ability, which places two triggered abilities on the chain. As each of those triggered abilities resolve, it deals damage to the unit chosen for that ability. If one of these abilities deals lethal damage to a unit, both Falling Star and its ability are considered sources of the damage, and so both Falling Star and its ability are responsible for killing the unit. This means that Falling Star&#x27;s controller killed a unit with a spell, so Immortal Phoenix&#x27;s ability will trigger. 415.6. This action is formatted as &quot;Kill [one or more permanents].&quot; e.g., &quot;Kill an enemy unit.&quot; e.g., &quot;Kill this, [2]: Draw 1.&quot; e.g., &quot;Kill all gear.&quot; 416. Add 416.1. Adding is the action of putting resources into a player&#x27;s Rune Pool. 416.2. Spells, triggered abilities, and activated abilities that Add resources finalize immediately. 416.2.a. Priority and Focus will not pass from Add abilities being finalized, and will resolve before any other outstanding items on the chain are finalized. 416.3. Activated abilities that Add resources and have the Reaction tag can be activated during the playing or resolution of other spells and abilities, any time that those spells or abilities require that resources be paid. Example: A player can add Energy and Power through any means before initiating the process of playing a spell. After initiating that process, in the Pay Costs step, they may activate Add Reactions to add Energy or Power to pay costs. 416.4. Adding is a Limited Action. 416.4.a. Players may only Add resources when Game Effects direct them to do so. 416.5. This action is formatted as &quot;Add [one or more resources].&quot; e.g., &quot;Add [2].&quot; means &quot;Add 2 Energy.&quot; e.g., &quot;[E]: Add [Y].&quot; means &quot;Add 1 Power of the Order domain.&quot; e.g., &quot;Add [1][G].&quot; means &quot;Add 1 Energy and 1 Power of the Calm domain.&quot; 417. Channel 417.1. Channeling is the action of taking one or more Runes from the top of a player&#x27;s Rune Deck and putting them on the board. 417.2. The Game Effect that instructs a player to channel 1 or more runes may specify the conditions or circumstances under which those runes enter the board. Example: A spell reads &quot;Channel 1 rune exhausted.&quot; As that spell resolves, its controller puts the top rune of their rune deck onto the board and that rune enters the board exhausted rather than ready. 417.3. Channeling is a Limited Action. 417.3.a. Players may only channel runes when Game Effects direct them to do so. 417.4. This action is formatted as &quot;Channel X rune(s),&quot; optionally followed by conditions or stipulations. e.g., &quot;Channel 1 rune.&quot; e.g., &quot;When you play me, channel 1 rune exhausted.&quot; e.g., &quot;Channel 2 runes exhausted. If you couldn&#x27;t channel 2 runes this way, draw 1.&quot; 418. Burn Out 418.1. Burning Out is an action a player must perform if they attempt to move one or more cards from their Main Deck to any other zone in excess of the number of cards remaining in their Main Deck: 418.1.a. If a player must Draw cards in excess to the number of cards in their deck, they will Draw as many as possible, perform this action, then Draw the remaining amount instructed. 418.1.b. If a player must put one or more cards from their Main Deck in any other zone, such as the Trash , in excess of the number of cards in their deck they will do so as much as possible, perform this action, and then complete the remaining number required by the instruction. 418.1.c. If an instruction directs a player to look at or reveal cards in excess to the number of cards in a player&#x27;s Main Deck , that player looks at or Reveals as many as possible, but does not Burn Out, then proceeds with the rest of the instruction. 418.1.c.1. If there are insufficient cards among the looked at or revealed cards to perform subsequent actions to the revealed or looked at cards, any further instructions are ignored. This does not cause a Burn Out , even if those instructions would cause those cards to change zones. Reminder: Cards are considered in the zone of origin while being looked at or revealed, in this case the Main Deck . 418.2. To Burn Out , a player does the following in sequence: 418.2.a. Performs as much of the prescribed action as possible. 418.2.b. Recycles their trash into their Main Deck. Reminder: When multiple cards are Recycled to the Main Deck at the same time, those cards must be randomized 418.2.c. Chooses an opponent to gain 1 point. 418.2.d. Completes the remainder of the action that caused them to burn out. Example: A player attempts to draw 1 during their Draw Phase while their Main Deck is empty. That player instead recycles their trash into their Main Deck, randomizing it as normal, then chooses an opponent to gain 1 point, and then draws 1. 418.3. A player&#x27;s Main Deck may remain empty as they Burn Out , usually because their trash is also empty. When they attempt to perform the original action again, it will cause another Burn Out . 418.3.a. Unless some effect intervenes, this will result in them burning out repeatedly, giving 1 point to an opponent each time, until an opponent passes the Victory Score and wins the game. 418.4. Burning Out is a Limited Action. 418.4.a. Players may only burn out when Game Effects direct them to do so. 418.5. Burning Out is a Replacement Effect. See rule 364. Replacement Effects for more information. 419. Double 419.1. Doubling is the act of increasing a numeric attribute by an amount equal to that attribute&#x27;s current value. 419.1.a. This creates an effect that modulates that attribute by that specific amount for the duration specified by the Game Effect that instructed the player to perform this action. Example: A unit with 3 base Might and Shield 2 is in combat as a Defender. Since Shield applies, its current Might is 5. A player chooses it as the target for Last Stand, a spell that reads in part &quot;Double a friendly unit&#x27;s Might this turn.&quot; Its current Might is 5, so it gets +5 Might this turn, for a current Might of 10. After combat, Shield no longer applies, but the +5 Might from Last Stand does, so the unit&#x27;s Might is 8. 419. 2 Doubling is a Limited Action. 419.2.a. Players may only Double when Game Effects direct them to do so. 420. Swap 420.1. Swapping is the act of increasing one numeric value and decreasing another numeric value on some number of Game Objects such that their values are reversed. 420.1.a. Swapping creates two different effects that apply to each attribute. One that Increases one value and one that Decreases the other. 420.1.b. To accomplish this, determine the difference between these values and then apply an Increase for that amount to the lower value of the two attributes, and a Decrease of that amount to the higher value of the two attributes. 420.1. c If both attributes are the same numeric value, Swapping has no effect. 420.2. Swapping is a Limited Action. 420.2. a Players may only swap when Game Effects direct them to do so. 421. Attach 421.1. Attaching is the act of linking two cards on the board together to combine their effects in some way. This causes one or more cards to become Attached and at least one card to become a TopMost Card. See rule 716 Attachment for more information. 421.1.a. Attaching affects two cards at once. 421.1.a.1. One card will be designated as the one being Attached , and thus become Attached. The other will become the TopMost Card. 421.1.b. This is represented by physically laying the TopMost card on top of the other or others such that all Effect Texts and Might Bonuses are showing, but nothing else from the card or cards Attached. 421.1.b.1. In the situation where there is more than one card attached to the TopMost card , they should be stacked in such a way that all Effect Text boxes and Might Bonuses are readable. The order of the Attached cards has no bearing on the application of effects. 421.1.c. The TopMost card has all Effect Text of all cards Attached to it appended to its Rules Text. 421.1.d. The TopMost Card has its Might modulated by the Might Bonus of all cards Attached to it. 421.1.e. Attaching one or more cards will cause those cards&#x27; Rules Text to become Inactive for as long as they remain Attached. See rule 716 Attachment for more information. 421.1.f. Attaching a card will cause it to Detach from any card to which it is currently Attached. 421.2. Attaching is a Limited Action. 421.2.a. Players may only Attach cards when directed to by Game Effects. 421.3. Attaching cards does not inherently choose or specify a target. However, Game Effects that Attach cards may do so. 421.4. When a card Attaches to a card, its location becomes the same as the new TopMost Card. 421.4.a. This is not a Move. 422. Detach 422.1. Detaching is the act of unlinking two cards that are currently linked through the act of Attaching . This causes one to cease being Attached , and potentially causes the other to cease being a TopMost card. 422.1.a. Detaching affects only cards that are currently Attached to another card. 422.1.a.1. Game effects that instruct a player to Detach a card that is currently not Attached to anything will do nothing. 422.1.b. When one or more cards become Detached , they cease to be in the Attached state. 422.1.b.1. To represent this, these cards should no longer be placed under the card they were previously placed under as TopMost Card. 422.1.b.2. If the TopMost Card no longer has any cards Attached to it after this, it is no longer a TopMost Card. 422.1.c. The card being Detached has its Effect Text become Inactive and its Rules Text cease being Inactive. 422.1.d. The TopMost Card ceases to have the Effect Text of the card being Detached appended to its Rules Text. 422.1.e. The TopMost Card ceases to have its Might modulated by the Might Bonus of the card being Detached. 422.2. Detaching is a Limited Action. 422.2.a. Players may only Detach cards when directed to by Game Effects. 422.3. Detaching cards does not inherently choose, or specify a target. However, Game Effects that Detach cards may. 422.4. When a card Detaches from a TopMost Card , its location is the same as the TopMost Card from which it Detached. 422.4.a. If the Detached card was a Gear and this causes it to become present at a Battlefield , it will be Recalled during the next Cleanup. 422.4.b. If the Attached card was Detached because the TopMost Card changed zones from a board zone to a nonboard zone, then the location that the Attached Card will Detach to is the last location the TopMost Card was at before changing from a board zone to a nonboard zone. 423. Movement 424. Moving is a Limited Action. 424.1. A Permanent changing its position from any space on the Board to another space on the Board is a Move , unless it is caused by a corrective Recall . See rule 407. Move for more information. 424.2. A card changing game zones does not in itself constitute a Move. 424.3. Moving is instantaneous. 424.3.a. There is no state for Permanents between locations. 424.3.b. Permanents are either at their Origin before Moving or their Destination after Moving. 424.3.c. Moving does not use the Chain , nor is it able to be Reacted to. 425. Moving is defined by the Origin and Destination of the Permanent that is changing locations. 425.1. The Origin is where the Permanent is starting from. 425.2. The Destination is where the Permanent is going to. 425.2.a. In Modes of Play with more than two players, Battlefields with Staged Combats or Combats in Progress are Invalid Destinations for Moves of all kinds ( Standard Moves or otherwise) by Units controlled by Players who don&#x27;t already have permanents at that Battlefield . 425.2.b. If an action would require a Move that would cause a Unit to become present in a Location where it cannot move for any reason, such as a Battlefield with two players that are not the controller of the Unit performing this Move action are in a Combat or such a Combat is Staged , it instead Recalls. See rule 432. Recalls for more information. 425.3. Units are the only Permanents that can Move. 426. Players may choose to move their Units with the Standard Move. See rule 142. for more information on the Standard Move. 427. Spells , Abilities , or other effects may cause a Move to occur. 427.1. The source of the Move will provide details on any restrictions on legality for Destination. 427.2. Units cannot Move to a Battlefield that already has units from 2 other players present by any means. 428. The Destination becomes Contested if it is a Battlefield not controlled by the controller of the Unit or Units that moved. 429. Units may cause a Showdown without a Combat when they Move. 429.1. A Showdown is opened when a Move causes a Battlefield to become Contested while it has no Units present from any player other than those that just moved. 430. Units may cause Combat when they Move. 430.1. A Combat is triggered when a Move causes a Battlefield to become Contested and Units controlled by opposing players. See rule 437. Combat for more information. 431. When a Move action is complete, perform a Cleanup. 432. Recalls 433. A Recall is when a Permanent is relocated from anywhere to its Base without it being a Move. 434. Recalls are not Moves. 434.1. They do not cause Triggered Abilities to trigger that are triggered by Move actions. 434.2. A Recall causes a Permanent to change locations. 434.3. A Recall cannot be prevented by actions and Game Effects that restrict or block Movement. 435. Gear can be Recalled. 435.1. When an unattached Gear is created or played at a battlefield, or is at a battlefield for any other reason, it is Recalled to its controller&#x27;s base during the next Cleanup. Example: An Equipment is attached to a unit at a battlefield, so the Equipment is present at that battlefield. If the unit dies, the Equipment will be recalled during the next cleanup. 436. Recalls do not affect the state of the Permanent being recalled. 436.1. Unless otherwise stated by the source of the Recall , Damage, Exhausted Status, Buffed Status, and applied Layer alterations will all remain unaffected by a Recall . 437. Combat 438. A Combat occurs when a Cleanup occurs, there are no items on the Chain , and a Battlefield has Units controlled by two opposing players. 439. Combat is considered Staged if there are units controlled by two opposing players at a Battlefield but the Steps of Combat have not been initiated. 439.1. If more than one Battlefield has Units controlled by opposing players at it at the same time, the Turn Player decides which Combat to resolve first. 439.2. If Staged Combats stop being Staged before the Steps of Combat are initiated, they are not resolved or executed. 440. Combat can only occur between Units controlled by exactly two players. 440.1. In Modes of Play with more than two players, Battlefields with Staged Combats or Combats in Progress are Invalid Destinations for Moves of all kinds ( Standard Moves or otherwise) by Units controlled by Players who don&#x27;t already have Units at that Battlefield. See rule 425.2.a. for more information on Invalid Destinations. 440.2. In Modes of Play with more than two players, Battlefields with Staged Combats or Combats in Progress are Invalid to be chosen as a location to play one or more Units by a player not involved in that Combat by any means, 440.2.a. If an effect would require a Unit be played to a Battlefield with a Staged Combat or a Combat in Progress , where the controller of the played unit is not a participant, instead the Unit is played to its controller&#x27;s Base. 440.2.b. Any subsequent reference to &quot;here&quot; in the corresponding effect is reassigned to the Controller&#x27;s Base , where the Unit was played. Any further effects that may be invalidated are invalidated as if the effect was mistargeted. See rule 352.5. Targeting for more information on Mistargeting. 440.3. All choices that would result in a Combat occurring between more than two players simultaneously are invalid and ineligible to be completed. 441. The Steps of Combat 442. Step 1: The Showdown Step 442.1. A Showdown opens at this time. 442.1.a. Establish who is Attacker and who is Defender. 442.1.a.1. The Attacker is the player whose unit(s) applied the Contested status to the Battlefield. They gain the Attacker designation now. 442.1.a.1.a. This player gains Focus as this Showdown begins. 442.1.a.2. The Defender is the player who did not apply the Contested status to the Battlefield. They gain the Defender designation now. 442.1.a.3. Units at the Contested Battlefield controlled by the Attacker gain the Attacker designation now. 442.1.a.3.a. If a Unit controlled by the Attacker becomes present at this Battlefield after this moment, it will gain the Attacker designation during the Cleanup phase following the action that caused it to become present 442.1.a.4. Units at the Contested Battlefield controlled by the Defender gain the Defender designation now. 442.1.a.4.a. If a Unit controlled by the Defender becomes present at this Battlefield after this moment it will gain the Defender designation during the Cleanup phase following the action that caused it to become present 442.1.b. Finalize items on the Initial Chain if establishing Attacker and Defender has caused Triggered Abilities to become Pending. 442.1.b.1. The Attacking player, who has Focus , places Triggered Abilities on the Chain first, followed by all non Defender players in Turn Order , followed by the Defending Player. 442.1.c. The State Closes if an Initial Chain was created. 442.1.c.1. Otherwise the Showdown continues, with the State Open as normal. 442.1.d. Players proceed with any play on the Chain as normal. 442.1.e. Focus does not pass upon closure of the Initial Chain, if any. 443. Step 2: The Combat Damage Step 443.1. When the Showdown closes, Attackers and Defenders resolve Combat Damage at the Battlefield that was attacked, using their current Might. 443.1.a. The Combat Damage Step only occurs if both Attacking and Defending units remain at the location. 443.1.a.1. If neither Attacking Units nor Defending Units remain at this stage, the Combat Damage Step is skipped. 443.1.b. Sum the Might of all Attacking Units. 443.1.c. Sum the Might of all Defending Units. 443.1.d. Starting with the Attacker , each player assigns an amount of damage equal to their summed Might among the other&#x27;s Units. 443.1.d.1. Assigning Damage is not Dealing Damage. 443.1.d.1.a. When all Damage is assigned, it will be Dealt simultaneously. These actions are not synonymous. 443.1.d.2. Abilities or effects may influence the order in which damage is assigned. Reminder: Lethal Damage is nonzero damage equaling or exceeding the Might of a Unit. 443.1.d.3. Units must have lethal damage assigned to them in full before damage is assigned to a different Unit. Example: If a player has 5 damage to distribute among four 3 Might units, they may not choose to assign 2 damage to one of the units and 1 damage to each of the remaining 3. They must assign at least 3 damage to one, and the remaining 2 to another. 443.1.d.4. Units cannot have more damage assigned to them than the minimum required to constitute lethal damage unless no further units remain to have damage assigned to them. 443.1.d.5. A player must obey all requirements and restrictions on damage assignment if able. Example: A player is assigning damage to the following units: a unit with Tank (&quot;I must be assigned combat damage first.&quot;); Caitlyn, Patrolling (&quot;I must be assigned combat damage last.&quot;); and another unit without any abilities. That player must assign combat damage first to the unit with Tank, then to the unit with no abilities, then to Caitlyn. 443.1.d.6. If multiple Units have abilities or effects that require a player to assign them damage with the same priority, that player may assign damage to those units in any order. Example: A player is assigning damage to the following units: two units with Tank (&quot;I must be assigned combat damage first.&quot;) and one unit with no abilities. That player chooses one of the units with Tank and assigns combat damage to it. Then they must assign any remaining damage first to the other unit with Tank, then to the unit with no abilities. 443.1.d.7. If a Unit has one or more Abilities or effects applying to it that demand it be assigned damage in a specific way that is exclusionary, then the assigning player chooses only one of those abilities to apply when assigning damage. Example: Caitlyn, Patrolling (&quot;I must be assigned combat damage last.&quot;) has been given the Tank ability (&quot;I must be assigned combat damage first.&quot;). A player is assigning damage to this Caitlyn with Tank and two units with no abilities. That player can&#x27;t fulfill both of Caitlyn&#x27;s damage requirements, so they may choose to assign damage to Caitlyn first, fulfilling the Tank requirement, or last, fulfilling Caitlyn&#x27;s printed requirement. They can&#x27;t choose to apply damage to Caitlyn in between the other two units, because that wouldn&#x27;t fulfill either requirement. 443.1.d.8. If there is more than one unit in which this situation applies to, each unit is dealt with individually. The assigning player chooses which ability or effect applies, and then resolves the assignment. If this creates a situation where now more than one unit must be assigned with the same priority, those units may be assigned damage in any order as normal within that priority. Example: Two copies of Caitlyn, Patrolling (&quot;I must be assigned combat damage last.&quot;) have been given the Tank ability (&quot;I must be assigned combat damage first.&quot;). A player assigning damage to these two Caitlyns and one unit with no abilities could choose to fulfill both Caitlyns&#x27; Tank requirements by assigning them both damage before the other unit. 443.1.d.9. If a unit cannot be dealt damage, then no amount of damage can be considered lethal. Such a unit is exempt from any considerations of mandatory assignment. Example: Kayn, Unleashed says &quot;If I have moved twice this turn, I don&#x27;t take damage.&quot; While Kayn can&#x27;t take damage, it is ignored for the purposes of assigning lethal damage in combat. 443.1.e. Deal Damage to each unit equal to the amount assigned to it. 444. Step 3: The Resolution Step 444.1. 1. Perform a Combat Cleanup. 444.1.a. Invoke a Combat Special Cleanup. 444.1.a.1. Insert &quot;2c. Heal all Units. &quot; 444.1.a.2. Insert &quot;2d. Recall Attackers present at the Battlefield if Defenders are still present.&quot; See rule 432. Recalls for more information. 444.1.a.3. Insert &quot;2e. Remove Attacker and Defender Designation from all Units and Players. &quot; 444.2. 2. If no Showdown or Combat is staged at this location, the player with Units remaining here Establishes Control . 444.2.a. Clear the Contested Status . 444.2.b. This results in a Conquer if that player has not yet scored that Battlefield this turn. See rule 182. Control for more information on Control. See rule 446.1. for more information on Conquering. 444.2.c. This does not have to be the player that applied Contested to the Battlefield. 444.2.d. If there are no Units remaining here controlled by any player, the Battlefield becomes Uncontrolled. 445. Scoring 446. A player Scores in one of two ways: 446.1. Conquer: A player gains Control of a Battlefield they did not yet Score this turn. 446.1.a. In Modes of Play with teammates, Battlefields under the Control of a teammate during the Beginning Phase are also disqualified from being Scored through Conquer by any means. 446.1.b. A player will gain control of a Battlefield after establishing Control by applying Contested first. 446.2. Hold: A player maintains Control of a Battlefield during their Beginning Phase. 447. A player may only Score , from either method, once per Battlefield per turn. 448. When a player Scores , two things occur: 448.1. The player earns up to one Point , depending on their current score. 448.1.a. The Final Point has additional restrictions. 448.1.a.1. Notably, points earned from sources that are not Conquer or Hold are not beholden to these restrictions. 448.1.b. When a player tries to earn a Point through a Score , and their current Point Total is 1 point from the Victory Score of the Mode of Play , the following occurs: 448.1.b.1. If the player has Scored through Hold , that player scores the Final Point. 448.1.b.2. If the player has Scored through a Conquer and has Scored every Battlefield through either method this turn, that player scores the Final Point . If the player has Scored through a Conquer and has not Scored every Battlefield this turn, that player draws a card. 448.2. Trigger Score abilities at the Battlefield that Scored. 448.2.a. Conquer abilities trigger at a Battlefield that was Conquered. 448.2.b. Hold abilities trigger at a Battlefield that was Held. 448.2.c. These will only trigger when the Battlefield is Scored; I.E. These cannot be triggered more than once per turn for a player. 449. When a player accrues Points equal to the Victory Score for their Mode of Play , they Win the Game immediately. 450. Layers 451. Layers are the mechanism in which Game Effects alter the Traits, Intrinsic Abilities, or other properties of Game Objects. 452. Layers are an organizational structure. 452.1. Layers only serve to structure the application and order that Game Effects apply to Game Objects to maintain consistency. 453. The layers are applied repeatedly until all effects operating on objects have been applied once and no changes have been processed. 453.1. Layers are applied in sequence. Each effect in them is applied as soon as able, and only a single time across all sequences. 453.2. When a sequence of applications completes, recur the process, and evaluate each layer again applying any effects that may now be applicable. 453.3. The removal or disqualification of an effect is separate from the application of the effect, but still can only be applied once. Example: Fiora, Victorious has printed Might 4 and says &quot;While I&#x27;m Mighty, I have Deflect, Ganking, and Shield.&quot; If a player places a buff on Fiora, her Might is increased in the Arithmetic layer, after the layer for AbilityAltering Effects. The AbilityAltering Effect layer is then rechecked and the abilities Deflect, Ganking, and Shield applied. Since each effect has been applied once and there are no other effects to apply, Fiora&#x27;s characteristics are finalized as 5 Might with Deflect, Ganking, and Shield. While a buffed Fiora, Victorious is in combat as a defender, an additional +1 Might will be applied in the Arithmetic layer, giving her 6 Might and the 3 keywords. Example: A buffed Fiora, Victorious is in combat as a defender when her buff is removed. Reevaluating the layers in sequence, she no longer gains Deflect, Ganking, and Shield during the AbilityAltering Effect layer, so when the Arithmetic layer is evaluated, neither the buff (which is gone) nor Shield (which she no longer has) apply. She goes directly from 6 Might with three keywords to 4 Might with no keywords.. 454. Layers are applied in the following order: 454.1. 1. TraitAltering Effects 454.1.a. This layer deals with effects that grant, remove, or replace inherent traits of Game Objects. Name Super Type Type Tags Controller Cost Domain 454.1.a.1. Assignment of Might is dealt with in this layer. Example: A spell reads &quot;A unit&#x27;s Might becomes 4 this turn.&quot; The unit&#x27;s Might is set to 4 in this layer. 454.1.b. One Game Object becoming a copy of another. 454.1.b.1. All Traits, including the Rules Text, replace or are added to those of the original Game Object as specified by the Game Effect directing the Copy. This is applied in this layer. 454.1.c. Effects for this layer can be identified by the phrase &quot;become(s)&quot;, &quot;give,&quot; &quot;is,&quot; or &quot;are&quot; in the text. Example: A permanent has the ability &quot;Other friendly units are Yordles.&quot; Other friendly units gain the Yordle tag in this layer. 454.2. 2. AbilityAltering Effects 454.2.a. This layer deals with effects that grant, remove, or replace the abilities or rules text of Game Objects . Keywords Passive Abilities Appending rules text Removing rules text Duplicating Rules Text from one Game Object to another 454.2.b. Effects for this layer can be identified by the phrase &quot;become(s),&quot; &quot;give,&quot; &quot;lose(s),&quot; &quot;have,&quot; &quot;has,&quot; &quot;is,&quot; or &quot;are&quot; in the text. Example: A permanent has the ability &quot;Other friendly units have [Vision].&quot; Other friendly units gain the Vision keyword in this layer. 454.2.c. Abilities of Effect Text of Attached cards are appended in this layer. 454.3. 3. Arithmetic 454.3.a. This layer deals with the mathematics of increasing and decreasing the numeric values of the traits of Game Objects. Might Energy Cost Power Cost 454.3.b. When an arithmetic effect has a limitation that applies, it is limited at the time of its application, and is &quot;remembered&quot; at that limited level for the duration of its effect. This process is called &quot;snapshotting.&quot; Example: If an effect gives a unit &quot;4 [M] to a min of 1 until end of turn&quot; choosing a unit with 2 [M], then the effect will generate 1 [M] until end of turn. 454.3.c. Might Bonuses of Attached cards are applied in this layer. 454.3.d. This layer applies arithmetic in the following way. 454.3.d.1. 1. Increases 454.3.d.1.a. Positive values, or increases, to Might are applied first. 454.3.d.1. b If there is a restriction or limitation to this increase, the limitation is &quot;snapshotted&quot; for the duration of the effect. 454.3.d.2. 2. Decreases 454.3.d.2.a. Negative values, or decreases, to Might are applied last. 454.3.d.2.b. If there is a restriction or limitation to this decrease, the limitation is snapshotted for the duration of the effect. 455. If more than one effect applies to the same Game Object in the Same Layer , or to each other in the same layer, then both effects will apply but their order may be determined by Dependency. 455.1. A Dependency is established if: 455.1.a. Applying one of the effects alters the existence of the other; or 455.1.b. Applying one of the effects alters the number of objects the other effect can influence 455.1.c. Applying one of the effects alters the outcome when applying the other non deterministically 456. To determine which effect Depends on another, determine which of the prior criteria applies, and then also which effect&#x27;s evaluation is altered by the sequence of applications. That effect is said to Depend on the other. 456.1. To resolve a dependency, the effects within the same layer that created the dependency must be applied such that: 1. Identify which effect Depends on the other within the Layer. 2. Apply the effect that is depended on first. 3. Immediately apply the effect that Depends on the first effect next. 457. If more than one effect applies in the same layer but no dependency is established, then Timestamp order is applied to the effects within that layer and sublayer 457.1. When an effect begins applying, it establishes a time for which it is compared against other Game Effects for purposes of resolving Layered effects as its Timestamp. 457.1.a. Timestamps are not rote values. 457.1.b. Timestamps are relative comparisons between effects and when they began applying to the game. 457.1.c. Timestamps are not referenced by Game Effects in any way. They are only used to finalize layered effects. 457.2. When Rules Text becomes Inactive for any reason, it loses its Timestamp. When it ceases to be Inactive, a new Timestamp is established. 457.3. Effects are applied such that the earliest Timestamp within each Layer and Sublayer applies first, followed by other Effects in that Layer and Sublayer in chronological order. 458. Modes of Play 459. There are multiple methods of playing Riftbound. 460. A Mode of Play must define several variables for the game. 460.1. Number of Players : How many people are playing the game. 460.2. Formation of Players : How the players are organized while playing. 460.2.a. This defines if a player is alone or on a team. 460.2.b. This defines the number of opponents. 460.3. Victory Score: The point total a player or team must reach to win. 460.3.a. Victory Scores can be any positive number. 460.4. Battlefield Count: Determines how many Battlefields are in play, contributed by players, during play. 460.4.a. This may influence deck building requirements in competitive settings. 460.4.b. This may involve utilizing less Battlefields than there are players. 460.5. Setup: Any changes to initial setup required for this mode. 460.6. Format: Conditions to win or additional rules added over play. 460.7. First Turn Process: Adjustments to each player&#x27;s first turn. 460.8. Unique Rules 460.8.a.

If more than one player remains after a concession, follow the steps for the Removal of a Player. 651.3. Removal of a player involves them no longer being able to make choices or otherwise influence the game. 651.4. If the player has Teammates due to the Mode of Play , that player&#x27;s Teammates also lose and are removed from the game. 652. If the game continues, follow these steps for Removal of a Player. 652.1. Banish all permanents and runes they currently control and all permanents and runes they own. 652.2. Remove the Battlefield they contributed to the game if it is in use. 652.2.a. If it was in use, replace it with a token battlefield with no abilities. 652.2.b. Any units or hidden cards there do not move and are otherwise unaffected by this process. 652.2.c. If the removed battlefield was applying any continuous effects, those continuous effects immediately cease, which may cause changes in the characteristics of units or hidden cards there. Example: A battlefield reads &quot;Units here have +1 [M].&quot; If that battlefield&#x27;s owner concedes and the battlefield is removed from the game as a result, units there immediately cease to get +1 [M]. 652.3. Remove all cards they own from the game. 652.4. Counter all spells and abilities of all types controlled by the player that has conceded. 652.5. Proceed with the game. 652.5.a. Turn 652.5.a.1. If the removed player was the Turn Player , play proceeds in Turn Order to the next available player in order. 652.5.b. Focus 652.5.b.1. If the removed player had Focus in a Showdown , the next Player in order receives Focus . 652.5.b.2. If the player being removed creates a state where all Players have Passed their Focus , the Showdown ends and play proceeds as necessary, E.G. Combat is resolved or a Cleanup is completed. 652.5.c. Priority 652.5.c.1. If the removed player had Priority during a Chain , the next Player in order receives Priority . 652.5.c.2. If the player being removed creates a state where all Players have passed Priority , then the most recent spell or ability on the Chain will resolve with Priority being reestablished as appropriate for the state after the resolution of that spell or ability. 700. Additional Rules 701. Buffs 702. Buffs are objects placed on Units. 702.1. Buffs can be tracked with a buff reminder card from a Riftbound booster pack or with any spare object in your surroundings. 702.2. Buffs can be added or spent. 702.2.a. To Buff a Unit , a player chooses a Unit and then places a buff on it. That Unit is Buffed for as long as the buff remains on it. 702.2.b. Spending a Buff removes a single Buff counter from a Unit . 702.2.b.1. A buff cannot be spent from a Unit that does not have a buff. 702.2.b.2. A player can only spend buffs on units they control. 702.3. There can only be one Buff on a Unit at a time. 702.3.a. If a Buff is added, or instructed to be added, on a Unit that already has a Buff , it is not placed instead. 703. Each Buff individually contributes +1 Might to a Unit. 704. Buffs are Game Objects and may be referenced, counted, or targeted by other effects as specified. 705. If a Unit leaves play, remove all Buffs from it. 705.1. Champions do not retain Buffs in the Champion Zone, even if they return there somehow. 706. Mighty 707. Mighty is a description that applies to some units. Other game effects can check whether a unit is Mighty. 708. A Unit &quot;is Mighty&quot; as long as its Might is 5 or greater. 709. A Unit &quot;becomes Mighty&quot; at the moment its Might changes from being less than 5 to being 5 or greater. Example: A Unit with Might 4 that gets +1 [M] becomes Mighty . Example: A Unit with Might 5 that gets +1 [M] does not become Mighty , because it was already Mighty. 710. Units on the board are evaluated according to their current Might. Example: A unit with a base Might of 3 is targeted by a spell that reads &quot;A unit gets +3 [M] this turn.&quot; As that spell resolves, its Might changes from 3 to 6, and it becomes Mighty . When that effect expires at the end of the turn, it will no longer be Mighty. 711. Units in NonBoard Zones are evaluated according to their inherent Might. Example: A unit in the trash is Mighty if its printed Might is 5 or greater. It doesn&#x27;t matter if there were effects raising or lowering its might while it was on the board. 712. Bonus Damage 713. Bonus Damage is an intrinsic property that can be granted to Deal actions that influence the amount of Damage that the action is distributing. 714. If more than one instance of Bonus Damage is applied or granted to a Deal action, all instances are summed and applied once. 714.1. Bonus Damage can only be a positive value, and can only increase the amount of Damage being distributed. 714.2. If, for any reason, Bonus Damage would be a negative number, then no Bonus Damage is applied to the action. 715. Bonus Damage applies to the total damage Dealt by one instance of the action. 715.1. If the Deal action has a single target, the amount of Damage to that target will be increased by the Bonus Damage granted to it. 715.2. If the Deal action has multiple targets, the amount of Damage dealt to each target is increased by Bonus Damage individually and separately. Example: Singularity is a spell that says &quot;Deal 6 to each of up to two units.&quot; A player plays Singularity while they also control Annie, Fiery, a unit that says &quot;Your spells and abilities deal 1 Bonus Damage.&quot; Singularity deals 1 Bonus Damage to both of its targets, dealing 7 to each. 715.3. If the Deal action Splits damage, then the Bonus Damage applies to the amount of Damage that will be Split . This can alter the number of targets eligible to be chosen. Example: Volibear, Furious is a unit that says in part &quot;When I attack, deal 5 damage split among any number of enemy units here.&quot; A player attacks with Volibear, Furious while they also control Annie, Fiery, a unit that says &quot;Your spells and abilities deal 1 Bonus Damage.&quot; Volibear, Furious now deals 6 damage split among any number of enemy units at its location, and can choose to split that damage among up to 6 units rather than the usual 5. 716. Attachment 717. Attaching is a limited action that causes cards to become linked to each other to combine their effects in some way. This causes one card to become Attached and the other to become A TopMost Card. See rule 421 Attach for more information. 718. Attached is the state of a card being linked to another card in this way. 718.1. A card remains in this state until Detached. 718.2. While in this state, the card&#x27;s Rules Text is Inactive. See rule 720 Inactive for more information. 718.3. While in this state, Abilities in the card&#x27;s Effect Text are appended to the Rules Text of the TopMost Card. 718.4. While in this state, the card&#x27;s Might Bonus modulates the TopMost Card &#x27;s Might by the value listed. 718.5. Attached cards still have all properties of being a card on the board while in this state. 718.5.a. Attached cards still have all Types and Tags while Attached. 718.5.b. Attached cards still can be chosen or targeted by game effects while Attached. 718.6. Attached cards cannot be moved separately from the TopMost Card they are Attached to. 718.7. A card may be Attached only to a single TopMost card at a time. 718.8. Attached cards may have different Controllers from their TopMost card. 718.8.a. Changes in Control of the TopMost card do not impact Control of Attached cards and vice versa. 718.8.b. An Attached card still appends the abilities in its Effect Text to the Rules Text of the TopMost card and modulates the TopMost Card &#x27;s Might by its Might Bonus. 719. A TopMost Card is a card that has one or more cards linked to it through the process of Attaching. 719.1. The Effect Text of all cards Attached to this card are appended to the Rules Text of this card for as long as they remain Attached. 719.2. This card ceases being a TopMost Card when there are no longer any cards Attached to it. 719.3. A TopMost Card and all cards Attached to it are at the same location. 719.3.a. When the TopMost Card moves, all Attached cards move with it. 719.4. The Exhausted and Ready state of the TopMost card does not affect nor change the status of the Attached cards and vice versa. 719.5. When a TopMost Card changes zones from a board zone to a nonboard zone, all Attached cards Detach from it, remaining in their current zones. 719.5.a. The player that controls the TopMost Card that changed zones decides the order these cards Detach in, and thus the order of any relevant effects that occur due to the Detach occurring. 720. Inactive 721.1. Card text can occasionally be assigned to be ignored, disregarded, or otherwise rendered as not applicable during the course of play. This state is referred to as Inactive. 721.1.a. Text marked this way is not applied at all while in this state. 721.1.b. Inactive Abilities do not trigger, do not apply, and cannot be activated. Inactive instructions are not processed. 722. Inactive text is still present on cards. 722.1. Cards with Inactive text still have keywords for the sake of Game Effects that want to reference or see if a card has a keyword. 722.2. Game Effects that parse or interpret text to determine target eligibility may still parse Inactive text for the sake of eligibility. Example: Spinning Axe is a gear with [Temporary]. While it&#x27;s attached and its rules text is inactive, its [Temporary] ability doesn&#x27;t trigger. However, a spell that reads &quot;Destroy a gear with [Temporary]&quot; could still choose and destroy Spinning Axe. 723. Rules Text is never Inactive by default. 724. Effect Text is Inactive unless the card with the Effect Text is Attached. 725. Inactive text can partially cease to be Inactive under specific circumstances and exceptions. 725.1. If an Attached card has a Passive or Replacement ability that applies during the process of Attaching or a Triggered ability that triggers off of Attaching , that text exists and can be processed as it Attaches. 725.2. If an Attached card has a Passive or Replacement ability that applies during the process of Detaching or a Triggered ability that triggers off of Detaching , that text exists and can be processed as it Detaches. 725.3. If an Attached card has an Equip ability, the Weaponmaster keyword can reference that Equip ability and any abilities that passively modify that Equip ability. 726. Keywords 727. A Keyword is a specific term that appears on Cards that acts as a shorthand for a specific game effect, or ability of any variety. 727.1. A Keyword can be an ability. 727.2. Keywords can be identified by having a colored highlight behind them. 727.2.a. The color of the highlight has no effect on gameplay. 727.3. Keywords can be referenced or specified by other Game Effects. 727.3.a. Other effects may grant Keywords. 727.3.a.1. The definition and rules of the specific Keyword will determine the behavior if a Keyword is granted while it is already present. 727.3.a.2. The effect that granted the Keyword will specify the duration for which it is granted. 727.3.a.3. If an effect that grants a Keyword does not specify a duration, the duration is as long as that Game Object remains on the Board or in its current NonBoard Zone. 727.3.b. Other effects may remove Keywords. 727.3.b.1. The effect that removed the Keyword will specify the duration it is removed. 727.3.b.2. If an effect that removes a Keyword does not specify a duration, the duration is as long as that Game Object remains on the Board or in its current NonBoard Zone. 728. A card can have any number of Keywords. 729. Similar to other rules text, execute any effects of Keywords in the order listed when reading the card from top to bottom of the rules text. 730. Keyword Glossary 731. Accelerate 731.1. Accelerate is a Unit ability. 731.1.a. Accelerate is functionally short for &quot;As you play me, you may pay [1] and 1 Power as an additional cost. If you do, I enter ready.&quot; 731.1.a.1. If the unit has a single domain, the Power portion of the Accelerate cost can be paid only with a Power that matches the domain of the unit. 731.1.a.2. If the unit has no domain or more than one domain, the Power portion of the Accelerate cost can be paid with [A] (a Power of any domain). 731.2. Accelerate is an Optional Additional Cost to be paid as a player plays the unit with the ability. 731.2.a. Accelerate costs cannot be paid while the unit is on the board, only as part of the steps of playing a card. 731.3. Accelerate has no function while on the board. 731.4. Multiple instances of Accelerate are redundant. 731.5. Accelerate, and whether or not a unit has Accelerate, is a characteristic of the Unit and may be checked or referenced by other Game Effects. 731.6. Accelerate influences the state of the unit entering the Board. It does not enter exhausted and then become ready. 731.6.a. Accelerate will not interact with, or trigger, abilities that are affected by units becoming ready. 732. Action 732.1. Action is a Permissive keyword. 732.1.a.

Action is functionally short for the following: 732.1.c.1. On Spells and Units: &quot;This can be played during showdowns on any player&#x27;s turn.&quot; 732.1.c.2. On Rune, Legend, or Permanent Abilities: &quot;This can be activated during showdowns on any player&#x27;s turn.&quot; 732.2. The card or effect with this keyword is not restricted to showdowns. This permission is inclusive of all other timings and options available to the ability as written or by default. 732.3. Action does not alter the function of any instruction of the corresponding card or effect it is on. It is only permission. Example: Playing a Unit with Action still has the inherent restrictions of playing Units without Action. It can only be played to the controlling player&#x27;s base or a battlefield they control. 732.4. Action is a referenceable characteristic. 732.4.a.

Assault remains in effect as long as the Unit maintains the Attacker designation. 733.2. If a Unit has Assault or has been granted Assault and is granted Assault by an additional source, the Assault Value of all granted Assault keywords is summed. Example: Petty Officer has Assault. It is chosen as the target of Cleave, which says &quot;Give a unit [Assault 3] this turn.&quot; After Cleave resolves, Petty Officer has Assault 4 this turn. 733.3. Assault, and whether or not a unit has Assault, is a characteristic of the Unit and may be checked or referenced by other Game Effects. 734. Deathknell 734.1.

The trigger will be added to the chain as a Pending Item before the card with Deathknell is moved to the trash due to a Kill instruction or a Cleanup. 734.1.d.3. Before the card with Deathknell is moved to the Trash , note its location, its attributes, and any other details related to the effect of its Deathknell to process the trigger after it has been Finalized . 734.2. Each instance of Deathknell a Permanent may have will trigger separately. 734.2.a. The controller will choose the order to add these Triggers to the chain. 734.3. Deathknell, and whether or not a permanent has Deathknell, is a characteristic of the permanent and may be checked or referenced by other Game Effects. 735. Deflect 735.1. Deflect is a Passive Ability keyword. 735.1.a. It is present on Permanents. 735.1.b. It is formatted as &quot;Deflect [X]&quot;. 735.1.b.1. The X is referenced in the functional text of the ability. 735.1.b.2. The X is referred to as the Deflect Value. 735.1.b.3. If X is omitted, it is presumed to be 1. 735.1.c.

The Power used to pay this cost may always be of any Domain. Example: A Fury spell targets an Order unit with Deflect. The Power used to pay the Deflect cost can be any Domain; it does not need to match the Domain of the spell or the target. 735.1.d. It is an effect that imposes a Mandatory Additional Cost on Spells and Abilities that choose the permanent that has this ability. See rule 346. Playing Cards for more information. 735.2. If a Unit has Deflect, or has been granted Deflect, and is granted Deflect by an additional source, the Deflect Value of all granted Deflect keywords is summed. 735.3. Deflect, and whether or not a permanent has Deflect, is a characteristic of the permanent and may be checked or referenced by other Game Effects. 736. Ganking 736.1. Ganking is a Passive Ability keyword. 736.1.a. It is present on Units. 736.1.b. It is functionally short for &quot;I may move to a battlefield from another battlefield.&quot; 736.1.c.

Hidden 737.1. Hidden is a keyword that acts as a prerequisite to perform the Hide Discretionary Action. 737.1.a. It is present on Spells, Units, and Gear. 737.1.b. It is functionally short for &quot;While this card is in your hand or in the Champion Zone on your turn during an Open State, you may pay [A] to hide this facedown at a battlefield you control that doesn&#x27;t already have a facedown card hidden there for as long as you control that battlefield. Beginning on the next turn, this gains [Reaction] and you may play this, ignoring its base cost.&quot; 737.1.c. It allows the player to take the Discretionary Action Hide . 737.1.c.1. Hide is not a subset of Play . 737.1.c.2. Hiding a card does not open a chain. 737.1.c.3. Playing a card from facedown (or &quot;from Hidden&quot;) does open a chain. 737.1.d. Some choices made while playing a card from Hidden are restricted to the battlefield where it was hidden. A card cannot be played from Hidden if it is a spell with no valid targets under these restrictions. See rule 352.5. Targeting for more information. 737.1.d.1. A hidden unit must be played to that battlefield. 737.1.d.2. If a hidden spell or a play effect of a hidden permanent chooses any targets, those targets must be chosen from among options at that battlefield, unless the ability explicitly restricts targeting in a way that makes this impossible. Example: Blastcone Fae is a unit with Hidden and &quot;When you play me, give a unit 2 [M] this turn, to a minimum of 1 [M].&quot; Because this is a play effect, its target must be chosen from among units at the same battlefield if Blastcone Fae was played from Hidden. Example: Tideturner is a unit with Hidden and &quot;When you play me, you may choose a unit you control at another location. Move me to its location and it to my original location.&quot; Because its play ability has a targeting restriction that can never be fulfilled by a unit at its battlefield, its target may be chosen freely from among the available options. 737.1.d.3. If a hidden spell or a play effect of a hidden permanent causes you to play a unit, you must choose to play that unit at that battlefield. 737.2. Abilities and instructions of hidden cards other than the choices listed above function as normal. Example: Stand United is a spell that has Hidden and says &quot;Buff a friendly unit. Buffs give an additional +1 might to friendly units this turn.&quot; If it&#x27;s played from Hidden, the first part of its ability must choose a friendly unit at the same battlefield, but the second part of its ability affects all friendly units with buffs, no matter where they are. 737.3. Instead of being hidden, a card with Hidden may be played for its cost as normal, at its normal timing with no restrictions on targeting. 737.4. Multiple instances of Hidden are redundant. 737.5. Hidden, and whether or not a card has Hidden, is a characteristic of the card and may be checked or referenced by other Game Effects. 737.5.a. This is independent of the state of being facedown. 737.6. A card that is Hidden gains Reaction while facedown, and may be played any time a card with Reaction may be played as a result. 737.6.a. The property is granted to the card in its facedown state, and is not publicly known. 738. Legion 738.1. Legion is a Conditional Keyword. 738.1.a. It can be present on Spells, Units, Rune Abilities, Legend Abilities and Permanent Abilities. 738.1.b. It is formatted as &quot;Legion [Text]&quot;. 738.1.c. Starting from the Keyword to the end of the clause, the entire statement is the Legion Ability. 738.1.c.1. On spells and on play effects of permanents, it is functionally short for &quot;If you have played another Main Deck card before this one already this turn, apply [Text].&quot; 738.1.c.2. On other abilities and instructions, it is functionally short for &quot;If you have played a Main Deck card this turn, apply [Text].&quot; 738.1.c.3. This is called the Legion condition. 738.1.c.4. Legion&#x27;s conditional can apply to passive abilities, activated abilities, spell instructions, or even abilities active in zones outside of the board. 738.2. All instances of Legion on cards a player controls are satisfied by that player playing a single card. Example: One card has three different Legion Abilities. The Legion Text of all three abilities apply as long as one card has been played by the card&#x27;s controller earlier in the same turn. 738.3. Legion, and whether or not a card has Legion, is a characteristic of the card and may be checked or referenced by other Game Effects. 739. Reaction 739.1. Reaction is a Permissive keyword. 739.1.a. It can be present on Spells, Units, Rune Abilities, Legend Abilities and Permanent Abilities. 739.1.b. Reaction grants the corresponding card or effect all abilities and permissions of Action. 739.1.c. Reaction , additionally, is functionally short for the following: 739.1.c.1. On Spells: &quot;This can be played during Closed States on any player&#x27;s turn.&quot; 739.1.c.2. On Units: &quot;This can be played during Closed States on any player&#x27;s turn.&quot; 739.1.c.3. On Rune, Legend, or Permanent Abilities: &quot;This can be activated during Closed States on any player&#x27;s turn.&quot; 739.2. The corresponding card or effect with this keyword is not restricted to Closed States or Showdowns . This permission is inclusive of all other timings and options available to the ability as written, Action&#x27;s permissions, or by default. 739.3. Reaction does not alter the function of any instruction of the Card, Rune, or Effect it is on. It is only Permission. 739.3.a. Playing Units with Reaction still has the inherent restrictions of playing Units without Reaction. It can only be played to the controlling player&#x27;s base or a battlefield they control. 739.4. Reaction is a referencable characteristic. 739.4.a. Whether or not a Game Object has Reaction is a characteristic of that Game Object and may be checked or referenced by other Game Effects. 739.4.b. Whether or not a Spell has Reaction is a characteristic of that Spell and may be checked or referenced by other Game Effects. 739.4.c. Whether or not an Ability has Reaction is a characteristic of that Ability and may be checked or referenced by other Game Effects. 740. Shield 740.1. Shield is a Passive Ability keyword. 740.1.a. It is present on Units. 740.1.b. Shield is formatted as &quot;Shield [X]&quot;. 740.1.b.1. The X is referenced in the functional text of the ability. 740.1.b.2. The X is referred to as the Shield Value. 740.1.b.3. If X is omitted, it is presumed to be 1. 740.1.c. It is functionally short for &quot;While I am a defender, I have +X [M].&quot; 740.1.d. Being a defender means the Unit has gained the Defender designation during Combat. See rule 437. Combat for more information. 740.1.d.1. Shield remains in effect as long as the Unit maintains the Defender designation. 740.2. If a Unit has Shield, or has been granted Shield, and is granted Shield by an additional source, the Shield Value of all granted Shield keywords is summed. Example: Stalwart Poro has Shield. It is chosen as the target of Block, which says &quot;Give a unit [Shield 3] and [Tank] this turn.&quot; After Block resolves, Stalwart Poro has Shield 4 this turn. 740.3.

It alters how players can elect to assign combat damage during combat. 741.1.c.1. Players must still assign lethal damage to a unit before moving to the next when assigning their damage. 741.1.c.2. If more than one unit with Tank is present with the same controller in Combat, damage may be assigned to any of them. Units without Tank are invalid assignments until all units with Tank have lethal damage assigned to them. 741.2. Multiple instances of Tank are redundant. 741.3. Tank, and whether or not a unit has Tank, is a characteristic of the Unit and may be checked or referenced by other Game Effects. 742. Temporary 742.1. Temporary is a Triggered Ability keyword. 742.1.a. It is present on Permanents. 742.1.b. It is functionally short for &quot;At the start of this permanent&#x27;s controller&#x27;s Beginning Phase, before scoring, kill this.&quot; 742.1.c. The Trigger Condition is the controller of the permanent&#x27;s Beginning Phase occurring. 742.2. Multiple instances of Temporary are redundant. 742.3.

Vision is a Triggered Ability keyword. 743.1.a. It is present on Permanents. 743.1.b. It is functionally short for &quot;When this is played, look at the top card of your Main Deck. You may recycle it.&quot; 743.1.c. The trigger is the permanent entering the Board. 743.2. Multiple instances of Vision trigger separately. 743.2.a. The player may choose to recycle or not recycle for each instance of Vision separately. 743.2.b. If the player does not recycle the top card and nothing else happens in between the triggers resolving, each instance of Vision will see the same card. 743.3.

The chosen Unit will become the TopMost Card for the Attach action. 744.1.c. Equip is formatted as &quot; Equip [Cost]&quot; 744.1.c.1. If paying costs or making choices for this ability causes triggered abilities to trigger, they will be placed on the chain above this ability in a Pending state. See rule 369 Activated Abilities for more information. 744.1.c.2. Equip is functionally short for &quot;[Cost]: Attach this gear to a unit you control.&quot; 744.1.c.3.

Such text is taken into account when determining a card&#x27;s Equip cost for any reason. 744.1.c.5. Equip abilities may include text that alters the timing or targeting of the Equip ability. 744.2. When the Attach action completes from this keyword, the Unit that was chosen is considered to have been Equipped by the Gear with this ability. 744.2.a. This is an event other Game Effects and Triggered Abilities can reference. 744.3. Equipped is the state of a TopMost Card being Attached by one or more cards that are Equipment. 744.3.a. The state of being Equipped is synchronous with that of the Attached state of the Equipment. 744.3.b. A TopMost Card is Equipped as long as one or more of its Attached cards are Equipment. 744.3.c. The state of being Equipped corresponds to a TopMost card having a card with Equip that is Attached to it. 744.4. Multiple instances of Equip are equivalent to multiple Activated Abilities and can each be activated separately by paying the corresponding costs. 744.5. Equip, and whether or not a Gear has Equip, is a characteristic of the Gear and may be checked or referenced by other Game Effects. 744.5. Whether or not a Gear has Equip may be referenced even if the Rules Text of the Gear is Inactive. See rule 716 Attachment for more information. 745. QuickDraw 745.1. QuickDraw is a Triggered Ability keyword. It is also a Permissive keyword. 745.1.a. QuickDraw is present on Gear with Equip abilities. 745.1.b. Cards with QuickDraw have Reaction inherently. 745.1.c. QuickDraw allows cards to be played and Attached using Reaction timing. 745.1.d. QuickDraw is functionally short for &quot; [Reaction] &quot; and &quot;When you play this, attach it to a Unit you control.&quot; See rule 716 Attachment for more information. 745.2. Multiple instances of QuickDraw do not trigger separately and have no effect beyond the first. 745.3. QuickDraw has no function while on the board. 745.4.

If a spell has more than one instance of Repeat , each Cost may be paid or not paid individually. 746.1.c.3. Each Repeat Cost can be paid only a single time. 746.1.d. Repeat is functionally short for &quot;You may pay [Cost] as an additional cost as you play this spell. If you do, execute the instructions of this spell one additional time.&quot; 746.1.d.1. When the additional cost is paid, the effect of the spell, upon resolution, will be performed an additional time. Example: Desert&#x27;s Call is a spell with [Repeat] [2] and &quot;Play a 2 [S] Sand Soldier unit token.&quot; If its controller pays its Repeat cost as they play it, the card&#x27;s instruction to play a Sand Soldier is executed twice, as though the card says &quot;Play a 2 [S] Sand Soldier unit token. Play a 2 [S] Sand Soldier unit token.&quot; 746.2.

See rule 346 Playing Cards for more information. 746.2.a. Choices made for the additional execution do not have to be the same as the choices made for the initial execution. Example: Rocket Barrage is a spell with [Repeat] [4][C] and &quot;Choose one Deal 4 to a unit in a base. [or] Kill a gear.&quot; If Rocket Barrage&#x27;s controller pays its Repeat cost as they play it, they may choose the same mode or a different one, and if they choose the same mode, may choose the same target or a different one. If they choose &quot;Kill a gear&quot; twice and choose two different gear, they must specify which gear is the first target and which is the second. As the spell resolves, those two gear will be killed in the chosen order. 746.3. Multiple instances of Repeat can be paid for separately. The spell&#x27;s instructions will be executed an additional time for each instance of Repeat that is paid for. 746.3.a. Regardless of the number of times a spell&#x27;s instructions are executed with this keyword, the spell is only Played once. 746.4.

Necessary portions of its Rules Text are no longer Inactive if they are currently Inactive. Pay the cost of its Equip ability, reduced by [A], to attach it to this unit.&quot; See rule 716 Attachment for more information. 747.1.c.1. Weaponmaster can choose an Equipment whether it has an Equip ability or not. 747.1.c.2.

A registered decklist must have a complete, unambiguous record of the player's Champion Legend, battlefields, Main Deck including Chosen Champion, Rune Deck, and sideboard (if applicable to the format). 401.3. Once a decklist has been registered and delivered to a competition official, it can't be changed. 401.4. In a constructed event, a player's deck must be registered prior to the start of the first round of competition. 401.5. IOther player's decklists are normally considered private information. The head judge of an event may run that event or the final rounds of that event using an open decklist policy. In this case, all players' decklists will be considered public information. 401.5.a. In an open decklist competition, each round players are provided with their opponent's decklist to review at the start of the match and in between games of the match. Players may not review decklists during gameplay. 401.5.b. Typically, professional OPL competitions should be run with open decklists, but it is ultimately up to the discretion of the head judge regardless of the event level. 402. Deck Size 402.1. In a constructed event, players must register a Main Deck of exactly 40 cards (including a chosen champion), 1 Legend, 12 runes, and exactly 3 battlefields each with a unique name. 402.2. Otherwise, deck construction is defined in the Core Rules. 403. Sideboard 403.1. In certain competitions, players may have a group of additional cards (outside of their starting configuration) called a sideboard. See 600 for more information on sideboards based on competition formats. 403.2. Sideboard size and contents are dictated by the competition format. 403.3. Limits on copies of named cards as defined by competition format apply to the combination of Main Deck and sideboard. 403.4. Players may use sideboard cards to modify their deck in between games of a match. Sideboard cards must be exchanged 1 for 1 with Main Deck cards. 403.4.a. During that time, a player may change their Chosen Champion to one from their sideboard or Main Deck that meets the deckbuilding rules of the competition format. 403.4.b. In constructed formats, a player may not change their Runes, Legend, or Battlefields at any point after deck registration. 403.4.c. After the sideboarding process, a player's Main Deck must meet deck size requirements dictated by the competition format. 403.5. Players may use those cards to modify their deck after the first game of a match. 403.6. Players may count the cards in their opponents' sideboards at any time. 403.7. A player may look at their own sideboard at any time, but must keep it distinguishable from other cards. 403.8. A player's deck and sideboard must be returned to their registered states before the first game of the next match. 403.9. If a match skips the first game due to a penalty or an intentional draw, neither player qualifies for 403.4. 403.10. If a game restarts due to an ingame effect or due to corrective action by judges, the state of each player's deck and sideboard must remain the same in the restarted game. 404. Match 404.1. A match of Riftbound consists of a series of games that are played until one side has won a predetermined number of games. 404.2. Most matches of Riftbound are \"best of 3,\" meaning the predetermined number of games to win is 2. 404.3. Games that end in a draw do not count toward this goal. 404.4. If the competition round ends (due to time limits) prior to any side achieving the goal, the winner of the match is the one who has won the most games. 404.5. If all sides have equal game wins, the match is a draw. 405. Start of Match Procedure 405.1. Prior to the start of each round, players must seek out information about their imminent match, opponent, and seating in the venue. 405.2. Players must arrive at their seats prior to the start of the round. 406. Start of Game Procedure 406.1. The setup process for a game of Riftbound is defined in the Core Rules. See CR 110. Setup Process. Additionally: 406.1.a. In competitions where sideboards are allowed, players may exchange cards from their main deck and their sideboard after each game of a match. 406.1.b. Each player must shuffle their Main Deck and their Rune Deck. See 420 for more information on shuffling. 406.1.c. Each player must present their Main Deck, Rune Deck, and sideboard (if applicable to the format) to their opponents. 406.1.d. Each player may shuffle the Main Deck and Rune Deck of each of their opponents. 406.1.d.1. In team competitions, each player may shuffe the Main Deck and Rune Deck of one of their team's opponents. 406.1.d.2. At Professional OPL, this is required. 406.1.d.3. A player may request a judge shuffle their deck in lieu of an opponent, to be honored at judge discretion. 406.1.e. For the first game of a match, start of game procedures may be performed as soon as both players reach their assigned seat, even before the start of the round clock. Gameplay must wait for the round clock to begin. 406.1.f. For competitions run using a \"best of 1\" format instead of a \"best of 3\" format, the head judge may opt to use the altered initial setup process listed below to closer mirror the \"best of 3\" experience: 406.1.f.1. Each player separates their Champion Legend and places it in the Legend Zone. 406.1.f.2. Each player randomly selects one of their three Battlefields, and places it into the Battlefield Zone. 406.1.f.3. Players use the Play First Rule listed below to determine the designated player. See 407 for more information on the Play First Rule. 406.1.f.4. The designated player chooses if they would like to go first or last. 406.1.f.5. Players then have the opportunity to sideboard as if they were in between games of a \"best of 3\" match. See 403 for more information on sideboards. 406.1.f.6. After sideboarding is complete, each player separates their Chosen Champion and places it in the Champion Zone. 406.1.f.7. Players perform shuffling steps 406.1.b.406.1.d.3. listed above, then proceed to CR 116. Setup Process. 407. Play First Rule 407.1. For the first game of a match, a designated player decides whether they wish to play first or last. 407.2. Any random method that is agreed upon by all players in the current game may be used to determine the designated player. 407.2.a. At high OPL, during playoff matches that occur following the end of Swiss rounds, the higher ranked player from the Swiss rounds is automatically the designated player for the first game of each match. 407.3. The player is designated and the choice of playing first is made during the Start of Game procedure. See CR 115. Determine turn order. 407.4. For games after the first game of a match, the loser of the previous game gets to choose if they play first or last. If the previous game was a draw, the starting play from the previous game is maintained. 407.5. For alterations to this rule for 2v2, see 603.7. 408. End of Match Procedure 408.1. A match is complete once a match result is recorded by players or a tournament official. 408.2. If the time limit for a competition round is reached before a winner is determined, the player whose turn it is finishes their turn. 408.2.a. After that player's turn is complete, three additional turns are played, and then the match ends. 408.2.b. If the game is incomplete at the end of the additional turns, a player is declared the winner of the game if they have a point lead of two or more. If no player has a point lead of two or more, the game is a draw. 408.2.c. Additional turns are untimed, but at professional OPL a judge must be present to ensure a reasonable pace of play. 408.2.d. If the players are between games when the round time ends, no new game is started. 408.3. The winner of a match is the first player who reaches the appropriate game win score. 408.3.a. If neither player has reached that score by the end of the end of match procedure, the player with more game wins wins the match. 408.3.b. If players are tied on game wins, the match is a draw. 408.4. Single elimination matches use untimed rounds so players can play their games to a natural conclusion. In the event that single elimination rounds must use a timer, the following altered End of Match Procedure can be used to determine a winner if time runs out: 408.4.a. When time is reached before a winner is determined, if players are inbetween games, if a player has more game wins in the match they win the match. If game wins are tied, proceed to 408.4.d. 408.4.b. When time is reached before a winner is determined, if players are in the middle of a game, the player whose turn it is finishes their turn. 408.4.c. After that player's turn is complete, three additional turns are played. At the conclusion of those additional turns: 408.4.c.1. If a player has the most points in the current game, they win that game. Then, if a player has more game wins in the match, they win the match. If the game score is tied, proceed to 408.4.d. 408.4.c.2. If the point score of the current game is tied, but a player has the most game wins in the match, that player wins the match. 408.4.c.3. If the point score of the current game is tied and the game score of the match is tied, players continue to play until the next point is scored. The player who scores that point wins the match. This does not remove normal scoring restrictions if the next point is the Final Point. See CR 448.1.a. for Final Point details. 408.4.d. If the game score is tied and a new game needs to be started, players start the new game and act as though time immediately runs out, beginning the process of 408.4.a., except with five additional turns following the first player's turn before moving into sudden death scoring as described in 408.4.c.3. if the point score is tied at the end of those turns. 409. Tiebreakers 409.1. In the course of determining standings, the scorekeeper might need to distinguish between two players with equal match records. 409.2. In these cases, the following tiebreakers should be applied in order: 409.2.a. The player with higher opponents' mean (average) match win percentage. 409.2.b. The player with higher game win percentage. 409.2.c. The player with higher opponents' mean (average) game win percentage. 409.3. If after all tiebreakers are applied, two players are still of equal standing in the competition, the scorekeeper should use a random method to break the tie. 410. Concessions and Intentional Draws 410.1. At any time before a game is completed, any player may concede that game or all players may mutually agree to draw it. 410.2. At any time before a match is completed, any player may concede that match or all players may mutually agree to draw it. 410.3. Players can't agree to concessions or draws in exchange for anything. See 704.5 for more information on bribery. 410.4. Players can't go to lengths to scout other match results before deciding to concede or draw their match and need to remain in their seats while their match is in progress. 410.5. If a player refuses to play, tournament officials should treat that as conceding the match. 411. Deck Checks 411.1. At high OPL, judges should perform deck checks during the course of the competition. 411.2. When deck checks are performed, at least 10% of all decks, chosen at random, should be checked during the course of the competition. 411.3. Deck checks for the players in a match should occur after players have randomized and presented their decks, but before opening hands are drawn. 411.3.a. If a deck check is performed within a match, judges should grant a time extension to that match sufficient to cover the logistical time needed to perform the check. 412. Judge Calls 412.1. At any point during a match, a player may pause to flag a floor judge. See 204.4 for floor judge responsibilities. 412.2. Time extensions should be granted if the total time of a judge call is more than 1 minute. 413. Appeals 413.1. If a player disagrees with a judge's ruling, they may appeal to the head judge. 413.2. At high OPL, the head judge may designate certain floor judges to be appeals judges, who are then empowered to hear and rule on appeals. In such cases, those judges must wear uniforms matching the head judge's uniform. 413.3. Players may not appeal before a full ruling is made by a judge. 413.4. Players may not appeal a ruling of an appeals judge or the head judge. 413.5. If a penalty is applied outside the scope of a competition, the appeals process should follow what's laid out on the official Riot Games website. [citation needed] 414. Dropping 414.1. Players may drop from a competition at any time. 414.2. If a player drops before the competition begins, they never participated in the competition. 414.3. Players who wish to drop must inform the scorekeeper before pairings for the next round of the competition are generated. 414.4. If a player doesn't show up for their match, they are automatically dropped from the competition unless they report to the scorekeeper. 414.5. Players who drop from limited format tournaments own the cards that they correctly have in their possession at the time of dropping, including unopened packs. 414.6. If a player drops from a competition after a top placement cut has been made, no player is advanced in replacement. The highest ranked remaining player receives a bye if the drop happens before pairings. 414.7. Players who have dropped may reenter the competition before the start of the following round at the discretion of the head judge. 414.8. Players can't reenter a competition if they missed a portion where a deck construction activity was required. 414.9. Players can't reenter a competition after a top placement cut. 415. Tracking Score 415.1. All players within a game are responsible for tracking all players' scores throughout the game. 415.2. Changes to score should be announced and acknowledged by all players. 415.3. Scores must be tracked, displayed, and updated legibly in writing. 415.3.a. At low OPL, an electronic device, dice, or similar methods can be used to track score. 415.3.b. If any player notices a score discrepancy, they must immediately make all players aware of it. If it can't be resolved easily by the players, a judge must be called. 416. Taking Notes 416.1. Players may take written notes during a match and refer to those notes during games in the same match. 416.2. At the beginning of each match, each player's written note sheet must be empty and visible to all opponents and tournament officials. 416.3. Players do not have to reveal their written notes to opponents. Judges may ask players to reveal and/or explain their notes. 416.4. Players may not refer to notes from outside the current game, including notes from previous matches, during games. 416.5. Between games, players may refer to notes they made prior to the match. They do not have to reveal these notes to opponents. 417. Electronic Devices 417.1. Players may use electronic devices during competitions, but can't use them during matches. 417.2. At low OPL, digital devices may take the place of written note sheets. 417.3. The head judge may further restrict or permit usage of electronic devices. 418. Coverage 418.1. Some competitions at high OPL use video capture of matches. 418.2. Certain events or portions of events may require players to appear on camera. 418.3. Spectators and players who are on camera during matches are responsible for behaving respectfully toward all participants. 418.4. Spectators are permitted to record matches using video capture, provided they do so without interfering with the match. 418.5. At Professional OPL, the head judge may consult video capture to help make rulings during a match. 418.6. Judges should never honor a player's request to consult video capture. 419. Proxies and Alters 419.1. A proxy is a standin, unofficial version of an actual Riftbound card. 419.2. Proxies are not allowed at competitions of any OPL. 419.2.a. The only exception is an official proxy issued by the head judge at their discretion to replace a card deemed unusable. 419.3. An alter is an official Riftbound card that has been modified in some way. 419.4. Alters are allowed in competition only if the modifications do not: 419.4.a. Modify or obscure the card name or cost, or make the art unrecognizable. 419.4.b. Contain substantial strategic advice. 419.4.c. Contain offensive images or text. 419.5. The head judge of a competition is the final decider on whether a card is acceptable for a competition. 419.5.a. Players using altered cards are responsible for having official unaltered versions of those cards to use during gameplay that is streamed or otherwise broadcast if instructed by a judge. 419.5.b. When instructed, players must replace the altered versions with the official unaltered versions before gameplay begins for a match that is streamed or otherwise broadcast. 419.5.c. Alters containing material outside of Riot Games intellectual property may not be permitted during matches that are streamed or otherwise broadcast. 419.6. The head judge of a competition is the final decider on whether a card is acceptable for a competition. 420. Card Language 420.1. Players may include official Riftbound cards of any language in their decks during deckbuilding and gameplay. 420.2. A player may call a judge at any time to get the Watcher wording for any card in the language of their preference. 421. Shuffling 421.1. Decks must be made random at the start of each game, and whenever an instruction from cards or tournament officials require it. 421.2. Random is defined as a state where no player could have any information about the order or position of cards in any part of the deck. 421.3. Shuffling by methodically placing cards into distinct piles (informally known as \"pile shuffling\") may be used as a method to count the deck, but can't solely be used to make a deck random. 421.4. When a deck is made random, it is presented to the player's opponent. This signals that the player believes their deck is legal and random. 421.5. Players must notify a judge if they believe their opponents' deck has not been made sufficiently random. See 703.7 for more information on insufficient randomization. 421.6. Players may shuffle their opponents' decks additionally. 421.7. Players must take care not to damage cards or sleeves through this process of shuffling, nor cause cards or sleeves to become marked. 421.8. When two or more cards are recycled to the player'sMain Deck as part of a single action, the above procedures 17 should be followed for that group of cards to properly randomize them before recycling them. 422. Sleeves 422.1. Players may use plastic sleeves or other protective devices on their cards. 422.2. If a player chooses to do this, all such sleeves must be identical and all cards in a deck must be placed in sleeves in the same manner. Cards in decks must have the same number of layers and be the same orientation at all times. 422.2.a. It's suggested but not required that players use different sleeves for the different decks (Main, Rune). 422.2.b. Players may use a unique sleeve or additional layer to distinguish their Chosen Champion during game setup, but must change its sleeve to match their Main Deck if it would enter a zone whose information level is private during gameplay. See CR 127. Privacy for information types. 422.3. Sleeves must have opaque backs. 422.4. During a match, a player may request that a judge inspect an opponent's sleeves. 422.5. Judges may disallow any specific sleeve or the sleeves generally if they believe they are marked, worn, inappropriate, offensive, or otherwise interfere with shuffling or play. 422.6. At high OPL, using sleeves for the Main Deck, Rune Deck and Battlefields is a requirement. At low OPL, using sleeves can be required at the discretion of the head judge. 422.7. At high OPL, sleeves must also not: 422.7.a. Have highly reflective backs. 422.7.b. Contain holographic patterns on the front or back. 423. Marked Cards 423.1. Players are responsible during competitions to make sure their cards and/or sleeves are not marked. 423.2. Marked is defined as bearing something that makes it possible to identify the card without seeing its face. 423.3. If cards are sleeved, they should be inspected for marking while in the sleeves. 423.4. Judges may ask players to remove sleeves or replace any specific sleeve at any time during a competition. 424. Display 424.1. During a match, the start of match procedure, and other relevant times during a competition, players must keep cards above the vertical level of the playing surface. 424.2. Players are responsible for making reasonable effort to prevent secret information from being revealed accidentally. See CR 127. Privacy for information types. 424.3. Players may reveal private information unless specifically prohibited by the Core Rules. 424.4. At high OPL, players don't need to inform opponents of accidentally revealed private information. 500. Communication 501. Requirements 501.1. Players are required to communicate honestly about the state of the game with their opponents. 501.2. Players are required to communicate honestly and completely with tournament officials. 501.3. Players are not required to assist their opponents in playing the game. 501.4. Players are required to treat other players, tournament officials, and spectators with respect. 502. Information 502.1. Cards have a level of privacy as specified in CR 127. Privacy. These apply to levels of information accessible to the players as well. 502.2. In addition to these levels of information, some information is derived. 502.2.a. Derived information is a combination of public information and a player's own skill or calculation. 502.2.b. Players are not required to assist opponents in determining derived information. 502.3. Like cards, other relevant information about the game state can be public, derived, private, or secret. 502.4. The additional relevant public information includes: 502.4.a. The current turn player, phase, step, state of the turn, and who has priority and focus. 502.4.b. Rune Pools and the number and quantity of resources in them. 502.4.c. All players' current scores. 502.4.d. A permanent's current state, as distinct from its printed ones. 502.4.e. Spells and abilities on the Chain, their order, and play choices made for them. 502.4.f. Spells and abilities that resolved previously in the turn, and the sources of them are themselves public. 502.5. The additional relevant derived information includes: 502.5.a. Which public cards have been recycled. 502.5.b. The order of runes in a Rune Deck. 502.5.c. Consequences of actions that might happen in the future, such as a unit receiving a Might bonus from the Shield ability if a player attacks. 502.6. Players must acknowledge changes to public information that result from their cards and effects as those effects would have an observable impact on the game. See 506.3.d. for examples of observable impact. 502.7. Players must answer honestly any questions regarding public information. 502.8. Players must not represent public or derived information incorrectly. 502.9. Players must point out discrepancies between announced and recorded public information. 502.10. Judges are encouraged to help players determine public information, but not derived information. 503. Shortcuts 503.1. In competitions, players may take actions that skip parts of the technically precise play sequence without explicitly announcing that sequence. 503.2. The most common type of shortcut is skipping one or more parts of a turn, phase, or step to the mutual understanding of all involved players. 503.3. Players may request to use a new shortcut in a game but must be clear about the game state at the start and end of the shortcut. 503.4. Players may interrupt shortcuts by explaining where they want to intervene to take an action. 503.5. Players may interrupt their own shortcuts. 503.6. Players can't use shortcuts they haven't previously announced or modify existing shortcuts without announcement. 503.7. Players can't interrupt a shortcut with the intent to do nothing. 503.8. When resolving spells or abilities, players can't assume their opponents are using shortcuts without asking. 503.9. The following are common shortcuts for Riftbound competitions: 503.9.a. When a player channels runes or draws a card at the start of their turn, it is assumed that they have passed through the Beginning Phase. 503.9.b. When a player places a spell or ability on the chain, they are assumed to be passing priority unless they explicitly announce they intend to retain it. 503.9.c. When a player puts a spell or ability on the chain and announces choices for it that are normally made upon resolution, they must adhere to those choices unless their opponents react. 503.9.d. When a player asks about choices normally made upon resolution, they are assumed to be passing priority and allowing the spell or ability to resolve. 504. Sequencing 504.1. Complex series of game actions are sometimes shortcutted into outoforder sequences, which are technically incorrect or imprecise, but arrive at the correct legal and understood game state. 504.1.a. Example: Drawing a card before channeling runes. 504.2. Players may ask their opponents to do these actions, or a subset of these actions, in the correct order so that they can react at the appropriate time. 504.3. Players can't shortcut outoforder in a way that gives them information prematurely that might affect decisions later in that sequence. 505. Loops 505.1. Some sequences of actions can be repeated and are shortcutted as a loop. 505.2. Players performing a loop must have each iteration of the loop be identical with no conditional actions. 505.3. To decide how to proceed with a loop, determine how many players are needed to maintain it (who must take actions or make decisions to sustain the loop): 505.3.a. No players 505.3.b. One player 505.3.c. Two or more players 505.4. For each maintaining player (if any), in turn order, that player chooses a number of iterations. 505.5. Each other player (if any), in turn order, may choose to agree to that number or choose a number of iterations after which they commit to taking action to break the loop or choose not to break the loop. 505.6. If no player chooses to break the loop and there were no maintaining players, the game ends in a draw. 505.7. Otherwise, the loop continues until the lowest number of iterations chosen, then that player either gains priority (if a maintaining player) or breaks the loop. 505.8. If a player intervenes to break a loop, they may choose to interrupt a partially completed iteration. 505.9. If a sequence of actions is nondeterministic, it may not be shortcut and iterations must be performed manually. 505.10. Some loops are maintained by decisions rather than actions. In these cases, apply 505.4505.8 but with the player making a different decision rather than a different action. 505.11. Judges are the final arbiter of what constitutes a loop, or if choices are available to continue a loop when secret information is involved. 505.12. Players who try to optout of shortcutting or propose incorrect shortcutting to use up time are cheating. See 704.8 for more information about cheating. 506. Triggered Abilities 506.1. Accountable Player: The player responsible for putting a triggered ability on the chain, as defined by the core rules. See CR 375. Triggered Abilities for more information on triggered abilities. 506.1.a. The accountable player for triggers sourced from battlefields depends on control of the battlefield and is not automatically the player who brought the battlefield to the game. See CR 184.6. For more information on battlefield abilities. 506.2. Players are not required to notify other players of triggered abilities when they are not the accountable player, but may if they wish. 506.2.a. At low OPL, a player is not required to notify other players of triggered abilities when they are not the accountable player, but it is encouraged for sportsmanship and learning. 506.3. The accountable player must acknowledge their triggers by the time they would have an observable impact on the game. If they do not, they are forgotten. 506.3.a. A trigger is considered forgotten once its point of observable impact has been reached and a new game action is taken without the accountable player acknowledging the trigger. 506.3.b. Players ruled to be abusing this rule to intentionally forget mandatory triggers that they are the accountable player for will be penalized. See 702.2 for more information about missed triggers as a penalty. 506.3.c. For triggers that occur \"At the start of each player's first Beginning Phase\", the accountable player has the full duration of the turn in which the trigger occurs to acknowledge the trigger before it's considered forgotten, regardless of its observable impact. (Example cards: Obelisk of Power and The Arena's Greatest.) 506.3.d. Examples of observable impact: 506.3.d.1. The trigger would change a point total. (Example card: Ahri, Alluring) 506.3.d.2. The trigger would change a rune total. (Example card: Startipped Peak) 506.3.d.3. The trigger would add a Buff token to a unit. (Example card: Sett, Brawler) 506.3.d.4. The trigger would impact combat or other game procedures. A card that reads \"When you play a spell, give me +1 Might this turn.\" does NOT have an immediate observable impact. (Example card: Ravenbloom Student) 506.3.d.5. A trigger would cause a player to draw or discard. (Example card: Traveling Merchant) 506.3.d.6. A trigger would cause a game object to be exhausted or readied. (Example card: Miss Fortune, Captain) 506.3.d.7. A trigger would cause a unit to move. (Example card: Stealthy Pursuer) 506.3.d.8. A player asks for public information that would be impacted by a trigger. See 502 for more information on public information. 506.4. A triggered ability that was forgotten never goes on the chain. 506.5. A triggered ability that was forgotten is still considered to have triggered for the purpose of nonoptional \"First time\" or similarly restricted triggers. 507. Teams in Separate Matches 507.1. Players may communicate with teammates at all times unless explicitly prohibited by the format rules. 507.2. Players that acquire secret or private information about a match in which a teammate is playing can't communicate with that teammate for the remainder of that match. See CR 127. Privacy for information types 508. Layout 508.1. In high OPL, players must arrange their cards according to the following rules, for clarity. 508.2. Runes must be closer to the player than nonrunes. 508.3. Nonrunes must be closer to the player's opponent than the player's runes. 508.4. Main Deck and trash must be together on either the left side or the right side of the board. 508.5. Rune Deck should be on the other side (right or left) of the board from the Main Deck. 508.6. Legend must be between nonrunes and Chosen Champion, and both legend and Chosen Champion must be together on either the left side or the right side of the board. 508.7. Each card or indicator that attaches to another card must be clearly associated with it physically. 508.8. Tokens must be represented by card objects that show all relevant information including ready state. 508.9. Buffs must be represented by an object that unambiguously represents a buff in game terms. 508.10. Ready objects must be oriented facing the controller. Exhausted objects must be oriented at a 90 degree rotation to ready objects, either clockwise or counterclockwise, but all exhausted objects must be rotated consistently. 509. Player Rewind 509.1. In competitions, players are responsible for considering options before taking actions. 509.2. Once an action is communicated to an opponent, that action can't generally be taken back. 509.3. A player can rewind and make a different decision about an action just taken if and only if they have not gained any new information since taking the action, and a judge allows it. 509.4. Judges who can't be sure a player gained no information should not allow that player to rewind. 509.5. Teammates recommending a player rewind a decision before any other information is gained should not itself be considered new information. 600. Competition Formats 601. Constructed 601.1. Deck Construction 601.1.a. The rules for constructing a Riftbound deck are found in CR 101. Deck Construction, except where modified here below for the competition Constructed play format. 601.1.b. In competitions, a player's Main Deck must be exactly 40 cards. 601.1.c. In competitions where a sideboard is allowed: 601.1.c.1. A player's sideboard can include 8 or fewer cards. 601.1.c.2. A sideboard can consist only of valid Main Deck cards. 601.1.c.3. Limits on copies of named cards apply to the combination of main deck and sideboard. 601.1.c.4. A player may change their Chosen Champion to one from their sideboard or main deck that matches their Legend whenever sideboarding would be allowed. 601.1.c.5. See 403 for more information about sideboards. 601.1.d. In some competitions, the legal battlefields are different from the formatlegal battlefields. If this is the case, it will be communicated to players via specific event addenda. 601.2. Card Legality 601.2.a. A card may only be included in a deck if it is from a set that is legal in that format or it has the same name as a card from a set that is legal in that format. 601.2.b. Until set release parity is reached, regional limitations on the legality of cards will be enforced according to the official product launch date in the region where an event is being held. 601.2.c. If an existing card is reprinted in a new set, but its collector number is not within the normal numbering of that set, it does not affect the card's format legality. 601.2.c.1. Example: A card with collector number 300/250 is not automatically legal within the standard format of that set. 601.2.d. If a card is banned in a specific format, that card may not be included in a deck. 601.3. Standard 601.3.a. Standard is a format consisting of the most recent 58 sets. 601.3.b. Each Standard consists of the current year's sets plus the previous year's sets. 601.3.c. The current Standard consists of: 601.3.c.1. The Origins supplemental set contained in Proving Grounds (OGS) 601.3.c.2. Origins (OGN) 601.3.c.3. Spiritforged (SFD) 602. Limited 602.1. Legality 602.1.a. A limited competition is one where all product needed for play is provided during the competition.modified here below for the Sealed play format. 602.1.a.1 A card may only be included in a limited deck if it is provided to the player as part of the competition. 602.1.a.1.a. For some limited competitions, players may be given additional promotional cards that the head judge will specify are not part of that player's limited card pool and can't be used for that event. 602.1.a.2 Players may utilize basic Runes from any source, even if they are not in the player's provided card pool. 602.1.a.3 Players may utilize as many \"blank\" battlefields as they need for limited gameplay. See 602.3.d. below for more information on \"blank\" battlefields. 602.1.b. Even if a card is banned in constructed, it is legal to use in a limited deck as long as it is not also banned in that limited format. 602.2. Abnormal Product 602.2.a. There is no guarantee that the composition or distribution of any specific unopened product is correct. 602.2.b. If a player notices a discrepancy between expected rarity or frequency of cards in a pack and what is opened, they must notify a judge. 602.2.c. The head judge may, at their discretion, replace atypical product in these cases. 602.2.d. In some cases, competition officials may allow players to provide their own product, but in such cases playerbrought products must be pooled and distributed amongst participants randomly. 602.3. Building From a Limited Pool 602.3.a. 602.1.a. The rules for constructing a Riftbound deck are found in CR 101. Deck Construction, except where modified here below for limited formats. 602.3.b. At high OPL, players may not use electronic devices to take notes or as a strategic aid during deckbuilding. At low OPL, this can be allowed by the head judge. 602.3.c. At high OPL, players may not receive any outside assistance during deckbuilding. At low OPL, this can be allowed by the head judge. 602.3.d. Limited decks can use battlefields from their provided card pool or any number of \"blank\" battlefields. Players may opt to use \"blank\" battlefields in place of battlefields they received in their provided card pool. 602.3.d.1. \"Blank\" battlefields function as battlefields that do not have any rules text. Otherwise, they adhere to all other normal battlefield rules as defined in the Core Rules. 602.3.d.2. At low OPL, \"Blank\" battlefields can be represented by anything agreed upon by all players in the game. 602.3.d.2.a. At high OPL, \"Blank\" battlefields must be represented by any official Riftbound card, put in an opaque card sleeve with the cardback facing outwards. 602.3.e. At high OPL, players must register a starting configuration from the card pool provided and must register the remaining contents of their card pool as their sideboard. 602.3.e.1. Players must use their registered starting configuration in the first game of each match. 602.3.e.2. Legend, Chosen Champion, and Rune deck composition must be registered as part of a player's starting configuration. 602.3.e.3. For \"best of 1\" competitions, players must register three battlefields to randomly select from during the start of game procedure, including any \"blank\" battlefields they wish to use. 602.3.e.4. For \"best of 3\" competitions, players may select any battlefield from their card pool or a \"blank\" battlefield during the start of game procedure. 602.3.e.4.a. Players may only use a specific copy of a battlefield once per match, but may use the same named battlefield as many times as they have copies of it in their provided card pool. 602.3.f. At low OPL, starting configuration registration is not required and players may freely change the composition of their starting deck and sideboard between games and matches unless otherwise specified by the head judge. 602.3.g. For card pool generation and deck construction rules specific to each limited format, see Limited Formats below. 602.4. Limited Formats 602.4.a. Sealed 602.4.a.1. Sealed is a limited format where players are each provided with 6 unopened Riftbound booster packs to open and use to construct their deck. 602.4.a.2. Main Decks for sealed decks must be at least 25 cards, but can be more. 602.4.a.3. The domain identity of a sealed deck is any three domains, or any domain plus the domains of the deck's Champion Legend. 602.4.a.3.a. A sealed deck may have any Champion Unit that is included in its domain identity as its Chosen Champion, even one that does not have a champion tag that matches its Champion Legend (if it has one). 602.4.a.3.b. A sealed deck may contain any signature spells that are fully included in its domain identity, even if the deck does not include the corresponding champion. 602.4.a.3.b.1. Example: A sealed deck with a domain identity of Fury/Body/Order could use signature spells that are Fury/Order or Body/Order, but not signature spells that are Fury/Mind or Body/Chaos. 602.4.a.4. Players may only include Runes from any source in their Rune Deck that match the domain identity of their sealed deck. 602.4.a.5. A sealed deck is still legal if it has no Champion Legend or Chosen Champion. 602.4.a.5.a. A player may opt not to use a Champion Legend or a Chosen Champion in their sealed deck even if they have one in their provided card pool. 602.4.a.5.b. If a player's deck is missing a Champion Legend and/or a Chosen Champion, they draw a card at the start of their first Beginning Phase each game. (If both are missing, they still only draw one card. 602.4.a.6. The normal restrictions on quantities of named or signature cards do not apply. For example, a player may use 10 Pouty Poro in their Main Deck if they received them in the provided card pool. 602.4.a.6.a. The \"Unique\" keyword does not apply in sealed. 602.4.a.7. A sealed deck's sideboard is every card provided to the player as part of the competition that isn't used in their starting deck configuration, unless otherwise specified. See 403 for more information on sideboards. 602.4.a.7.a. Additionally, players may change their domain identity, Rune Deck, Legend, and Chosen Champion while sideboarding as long as the resulting deck still meets 602.4.a.2602.4.a.4. 602.4.a.8. Sealed Pool Registration & Deck Construction 602.4.a.8.a. At high OPL, the head judge must require registration of the sealed pool prior to deck construction. 602.4.a.8.b. Each player receives the unopened product at their seat. 602.4.a.8.c. Players on one side of the table (A) open their product, observed by players on the other side (B). 602.4.a.8.d. Players verify that the product has the correct undamaged quantity of cards and rarity distribution. If a pack with an error is found, call a judge to replace the pack if possible. 602.4.a.8.e. Once all unopened product has been opened and observed by B, those cards are placed next to B. 602.4.a.8.f. Repeat the steps outlined in 602.4.8.ce but with (B) opening and (A) observing. 602.4.a.8.g. Each player now sorts and registers the contents of the pool placed next to them. 602.4.a.8.h. After registration is complete, each player returns the pool and registration sheet to the other player. 602.4.a.8.i. Each player verifies that their own pool has been registered correctly. 602.4.a.8.j. Deck construction begins. 602.4.a.8.k. It's recommended that players be given 20 minutes for deck registration and 30 minutes for deck construction. Deck construction can be increased to 45 minutes for low OPL events where players are experiencing the cards for the first time, such as prerift and release events. 602.4.a.8.l. The starting deck configuration and sideboard are registered on the same sheet as the total card pool. 602.4.a.9. Preconstructed Decks in Sealed Competitions 602.4.a.9.a. Some competitions or portions of competitions provide preconstructed decks for players to use. These are considered sealed decks. 602.4.a.9.b. Players must use exactly the decks provided, except as modified by any addenda to the competition. 602.4.a.9.b.1. This may override the sealed deck construction rules above. 602.4.b. Draft 602.4.b.1. Draft is a limited format where players are each provided with 3 unopened Riftbound booster packs to open and draft amongst other players. 602.4.b.2. Draft groups consist of as close to eight players as possible, seated randomly around a table. Draft process is as follows: 602.4.b.2.a. Each player opens one of their boosters, removes the Rune or token, then looks through the remaining contents to ensure there are thirteen undamaged cards in the pack with a correct rarity distribution. 602.4.b.2.a.1. Players can keep the Rune or token they opened. 602.4.b.2.a.2. If an opened pack has an error, players must call a judge to replace the pack if possible. 602.4.b.2.b. Once pack contents are verified, players will look through the cards in their pack and select one to draft to the top of a single unobscured facedown pile in front of them, then pass the remaining contents facedown to the player to their left. Players repeat this process with the cards passed to them until there are no cards remaining. 602.4.b.2.b.1. Once the first pack is completed, repeat 602.4.b.2.a602.4.b.2.b with the second pack, except passing cards to the right. 602.4.b.2.b.2. Once the second pack is completed, repeat 602.4.b.2.a602.4.b.2.b with the third pack, again passing cards to the left. 602.4.b.2.b.3. Once a card has been added to a player's single facedown pile in front of them it is considered selected and can't be returned to the pack. 602.4.b.2.b.4. Players must make a reasonable effort to conceal the front face of cards they have selected and cards in their current pack from other players. 602.4.b.2.c. Once this process is complete, each player should have 39 cards to use as their limited card pool. 602.4.b.2.d. At high OPL, players may not use electronic devices to take notes or as a strategic aid during drafting. At low OPL, this can be allowed by the head judge. 602.4.b.2.e. At high OPL, players may not receive any outside assistance during drafting. At low OPL, this can be allowed by the head judge. 602.4.b.2.f. At high OPL, during the draft process players may not reveal cards they have seen or selected, or openly discuss the draft. At low OPL, this can be allowed by the head judge. 602.4.b.2.g. During the draft process, players are not permitted to seek knowledge of cards fronts other drafters are viewing or have already selected through any means. Attempting to do so is cheating. 602.4.b.2.g.1. It is not cheating for a player to see card backs of cards other players are viewing or of cards players have added to the facedown pile in front of them. 602.4.b.2.h. At high OPL, players can't look at the cards they have already drafted, except during intervals designated by a judge between packs. At low OPL, this is allowed at any time as long as the player is not holding other cards at the same time. 602.4.b.2.i. At professional OPL, drafts must be timed. At competitive OPL, drafts are timed at the discretion of the head judge. At casual OPL, drafts are untimed but players must draft at a reasonable pace. 602.4.b.3. Main Decks for draft decks must be at least 20 cards, but can be more. 602.4.b.4. The domain identity of a draft deck is any three domains, or any domain plus the domains of the deck's Champion Legend. 602.4.b.4.a. A draft deck may have any Champion Unit that is included in its domain identity as its Chosen Champion, even one that does not have a champion tag that matches its Champion Legend (if it has one). 602.4.b.4.b. A draft deck may contain any signature spells that are fully included in its domain identity, even if the deck does not include the corresponding champion. 602.4.b.4.b.1. Example: A draft deck with a domain identity of Fury/Body/Order could use signature spells that are Fury/Order or Body/Order, but not signature spells that are Fury/Mind or Body/Chaos. 602.4.b.5. Players may only include Runes from any source in their Rune Deck that match the domain identity of their draft deck. 602.4.b.6. A draft deck is still legal if it has no Champion Legend or Chosen Champion. 602.4.b.6.a. A player may opt not to use a Champion Legend or a Chosen Champion in their draft deck even if they have them among their drafted cards. 602.4.b.6.b. If a player's deck is missing a Champion Legend and/or a Chosen Champion, they draw a card at the start of their first Beginning Phase each game. (If both are missing, they still only draw one card.) 602.4.b.7. The normal restrictions on quantities of named or signature cards do not apply. For example, a player may use 10 Pouty Poro in their Main Deck if they selected them during the draft. 602.4.b.7.a. The \"Unique\" keyword does not apply in draft. 602.4.b.8. A draft deck's sideboard is every card drafted by the player as part of the competition that isn't used in their starting deck configuration, unless otherwise specified. See 403 for more information on sideboards. 602.4.b.8.a. Additionally, players may change their domain identity, Rune Deck, Legend, and Chosen Champion while sideboarding as long as the resulting deck still meets 602.4.b.3602.4.b.5. 603. 2v2 603.1. A 2v2 team consists of 2 players who enter a competition together and register together as a team to play congruently in a single match as described in the Core Rules. 603.2. Each player must provide their individual registration information to enter the competition. 603.2.a. When registering, teams must specify an ordering for the players on their team for seating purposes by indicating an A player and a B player. 603.3. If a player drops from a competition, their entire team is dropped. 603.4. If a player is disqualified from a competition, their entire team is disqualified. 603.5. In some competitions, 2v2 teams may provide a team name to be displayed. Tournament officials may disallow a specific name for any reason. 603.6. A 2v2 competition can be either constructed or sealed. In sealed 2v2, the team shares a single product pool of 8 packs. 603.7. During matches, teammates sit next to each other in their registered AB order. The setup process for a game of Riftbound is defined in the Core Rules, with these additional exceptions for 2v2: 603.7.a. Turn order is as follows: 603.7.a.1. The first team's A player. 603.7.a.2. The second team's A player. 603.7.a.3. The first team's B player. 603.7.a.4. The second team's B player. 603.7.a.5. Return to the top of the order. 603.7.b. A random method is used to decide which team selects the starting player. 603.7.c. Once the appropriate step in the core rules process is reached, the team that earned the decision chooses where within the a.14 turn order play begins. 603.7.c.1. For games after the first game of a match, the losing team of the previous game gets to choose who plays first. If the previous game was a draw, the turn order from the previous game is maintained. 604. Event and Round Time Limits 604.1. It's recommended that players be given 60 minutes for rounds of play in the Swiss portion of a competitive event. 604.2. It is strongly recommended that single elimination matches use untimed rounds so players can play their games to a natural conclusion. If single elimination rounds must be timed, see 408.4. for an altered End of Match procedure. 604.2.a. Players are still expected to play at a reasonable pace. See 703.2 the Slow Play penalty. 700. Enforcement and Penalties 701. General 701.1. Philosophy 701.1.a. Errors are assumed to be committed unintentionally. If the judge believes it was intentional, it is cheating. See 704.8 for more information about cheating. 701.1.a.1. Players attempting to abuse error remedies to receive advantages are cheating. 701.1.b. Judges are neutral arbiters and enforcers of policy and rules. 701.1.c. Judges should not stop errors from occurring. Instead they deal with errors that have occurred. 701.1.d. Judges should not intervene in games unless: 701.1.d.1. They believe a violation has occurred. 701.1.d.2. A player requested assistance. 701.1.d.3. They observe a situation related to Unsporting Conduct. 701.1.e. Judges should model fair play, sporting conduct, and diplomatic behavior. 701.1.f. Judges should not account for a player's history or skill when determining whether errors occurred. 701.1.g. Judges may take into account a player's history or skill when investigating. 701.1.h. Penalties are designed to educate players on mistakes and encourage them not to make them in the future. 701.1.i. Penalties are also designed to deter other players from similar errors. 701.1.j. Penalties are issued and tracked to help judges understand intent over patterns of behavior. 701.1.k. Head judges and head judges ONLY may issue penalties outside of these guidelines. 701.1.l. Judges are human and they make mistakes. 701.1.m. If a judge recognizes their own mistakes, they should acknowledge them and correct them if possible. 701.1.n. If a competition official makes a mistake and it results in a penalty applied to a player, the head judge can downgrade the penalty. 701.1.o. If a player acts on information given in error by a competition official, the head judge can rewind the game to account for it, even if there were no other errors. 701.2. Definitions of Penalties 701.2.a. Warning: An indication that an error occurred that provides a record of the error. 701.2.a.1. Time extensions should be granted if the total time to rule and correct is more than 1 minute. 701.2.b. Game Loss: A game loss causes the erroring player and any of their teammates to concede the game. If this does not result in a winner, remaining players continue the game. 701.2.b.1. Game losses are applied immediately if the game is ongoing, or to the player's next game in the competition if it is not. 701.2.b.2. If a player would receive multiple game losses at the same time, they only receive one. 701.2.b.3. If all players in a match receive a game loss simultaneously, the current game ends in a draw. All game losses are recorded but do not affect the match score. 701.2.c. Match Loss: A severe penalty that's issued when the entire match has been compromised by the error. 701.2.c.1. Match losses are applied to the current match, or to the player's next match in the competition if their previous match has ended. 701.2.d. Disqualification: A penalty issued for errors that damage the integrity of the competition or for severe misconduct. 701.2.d.1. Disqualification causes that player to lose the current match and be dropped from the competition. 701.2.d.2. If a player has already physically received prizes from the competition, they keep them, but they will not receive any other prizes after disqualification, even if their placement in the event would otherwise entitle them to prizes. 701.2.d.3. When a player is disqualified, they are removed from the competition and from standings. 701.2.d.4. Any attendee of a competition can be issued a disqualification, not just players. Being barred from the tournament venue may apply to disqualification at the head judge's discretion. 701.2.d.5. This penalty can be issued by the head judge even without conclusive proof if the head judge determines the integrity of the competition has been compromised. 701.3. Applying Penalties 701.3.a. Penalties of Game Loss of higher (bd) should be reported to the head judge. 701.3.b. Judges should explain the error, the procedure to fix it, and the penalties for involved players. 701.3.c. Some errors include remedies beyond the scope of the base penalty, to protect competition officials from accusations of bias. 701.3.d. If a single error leads to multiple related penalties, judges should issue only the one with the most severe penalty. 701.4. Shuffling 701.4.a. Some remedies require shuffling the randomized portion of the deck. 701.4.b. Many cards recycle cards to the bottom of a deck. The judge should do what they can using information available from the game state and from the players to determine which portion of the deck is knowable by one or more players, and separate those before shuffling that deck. 701.4.c. Once the deck has been shuffled, any cards set aside in this way should be returned to their proper locations in the deck. 701.4.d. Shuffles performed by a judge in this way are not considered shuffles in game terms. 701.5. Rewinding 701.5.a. Some remedies allow rewinding the game state in extreme circumstances, where leaving the game in its current state is substantially worse than rewinding. 701.5.b. Some rewinds are simple; this means rewinding only the last action completed or one currently in progress. 701.5.b.1. Any judge may perform a simple rewind where they believe no information has been gained by the players. 701.5.c. For rewinds more complicated than a simple rewind, only the head judge or designated appeals judges (at high OPL) may authorize rewinding in this way. 701.5.d. To rewind: 701.5.d.1. Each individual action since the time of the error is reversed, starting with the most recent one. 701.5.d.2. Every action must be reversed in the correct sequence. 701.5.d.3. If the identity of a card involved in a rewind is nonpublic (e.g. a drawn card), a random card is chosen from possible candidates. 701.5.d.4. If a player learned the identity of a card in a deck, but did not draw or channel it, it should be shuffled into the random part of the deck. 701.6. Investigations 701.6.a. Any penalty that results in disqualification automatically starts an investigation into that player and patterns of behavior that might impact their eligibility in future competitions. 701.6.b. Investigations may also occur at a judge's discretion following the application of a penalty if cheating is suspected. See 704.8 for more information about cheating. 701.6.c. The result of an investigation can be suspension of the player from Riftbound competitions. 701.6.d. Suspended players may not enter Riftbound competitions. If a suspended player is found to have registered for a competition, the organizer reserves the right to issue a disqualification at any time. 702. Game Play Errors 702.1. Overview 702.1.a. A game play error is caused by incorrect and inaccurate play of the game that violates the Core Rules. 702.1.b. Except for 702.16, if a player commits the same category of game play error [Warning] 3 or more times in the same day of a competition, the penalty is upgraded to [Game Loss]. 702.1.c. At low OPL, penalties should generally be less harsh and rewinds may be applied even if the erroring player gains an information advantage. 702.1.c.1. Penalties that require an opponent of the erroring player to make a choice can be made at random or by a judge if they can't be avoided by a rewind. 702.2. Missed Trigger [No Penalty]: The accountable player for a triggered ability doesn't demonstrate awareness of the trigger before the first time it would have an observable impact on the game. 702.2.a. See 506 for definition of triggered abilities. 702.2.b. After the initial point at which a triggered ability is missed, any further errors related to that trigger are considered a General Error instead. See 702.15 for more information about General Errors. 702.2.c. Players may not attempt to cause triggered abilities where an opponent is the accountable player to be missed by taking game actions or otherwise prematurely advancing the game, including through otherwise acceptable shortcuts. 702.2.d. A triggered ability is considered to have triggered even if it was subsequently missed. Effects that count or restrict the number of times that ability can trigger will count the missed one. 702.2.e. If a mandatory trigger is missed by its accountable player and missing that trigger is advantageous for them, this penalty is a [Warning] instead. 702.2.f. Remedies: 702.2.f.1. If the trigger was missed during a previous turn, instruct the players to continue playing. 702.2.f.2. Otherwise, the next opponent in turn order of the player who missed the trigger chooses whether to resolve the trigger immediately or miss it altogether. 702.3. Forgetting to Score a Point [No Penalty]: A player is entitled to a point from conquering or holding a battlefield but fails to track it. 702.3.a. This does not apply to points that would be scored from card triggers such as Ahri, Alluring. 702.3.b. Remedies: 702.3.b.1. If the correct score can be determined and no more than a full round cycle has passed, increment the appropriate player's score to that total. 702.3.b.2. Otherwise, instruct the players to continue playing. 702.4. Forgetting to Draw Cards [No Penalty]: A player is obligated to draw a card, either as part of their draw phase or instruction from a card, but fails to do so. 702.4.a. Remedies: 702.4.a.1. If the missed draws can be determined and no more than a full round cycle has passed, the appropriate player draws the missing cards. 702.4.a.2. Otherwise, instruct the players to continue playing. 702.4.b. If forgetting to draw was advantageous to the erroring player (example: the player is near burning out), this penalty is a [Warning] instead. 702.5. Looking at Extra Cards [Warning]: A player takes an action that enables them to see the faces of cards they are not entitled to see. 702.5.a. Players are not entitled to see cards that are private (to another player) or secret. 702.5.b. Cards in a deck are considered to be in that deck unless and until they touch cards in another private or secret group. If that happens, the error is instead a Secret Card Error. 702.5.c. Remedies: 702.5.c.1. If the cards remain in a single deck, shuffle the deck appropriately to remove the information advantage. 702.6. Channeling Too Many Runes [Warning]: A player channels a number of runes greater than they are entitled to under the Core Rules as the result of a limited action. 702.6.a. Errors of this sort are generally public, and all players are expected to be mindful of game state. 702.6.b. Remedies: 702.6.b.1. If the additional runes have been used to pay for actions, rewind if possible. If rewinding is not possible, this is a General Error instead. See 702.15 for more information about General Errors. 702.6.b.2. If the additional runes are caught and no more than a full round cycle has passed, shuffle them appropriately into the rune deck. 702.6.b.2.a. If the specific runes can't be identified, shuffle random runes instead. 702.6.b.3. Otherwise, instruct the players to continue playing. 702.7. Channeling Too Few Runes [No Penalty]: A player channels a number of runes less than what they are entitled to under the Core Rules as the result of a limited action. 702.7.a. Errors of this sort are generally public, and all players are expected to be mindful of game state. 702.7.b. Remedies: 702.7.b.1. If no more than a full round cycle has passed, allow the player to channel the appropriate number of runes. 702.7.b.2. Otherwise, instruct the players to continue playing. 702.7.c. If forgetting to channel runes was advantageous to the erroring player, this penalty is a [Warning] instead. 702.8. Overpayment for Cost [No Penalty]: A player pays a cost overpaying its power or energy cost. 702.8.a. Errors of this sort are generally public, and all players are expected to be mindful of game state. 702.8.b. Remedies: 702.8.b.1. If a cost is overpaid and it is still the turn where the cost was paid, the overpaying player is considered to have the extra resources floating in their resource pool. 702.8.b.1.a. If overpaying a cost was advantageous to the erroring player, this penalty is a [Warning] instead. 702.8.b.1.b. If overpaying a cost caused a result that would not otherwise have happened, it is a General Error. See 702.15 for more information about General Errors. 702.9. Mispayment for Cost [Warning]: A player pays a cost underpaying its power or energy cost, or uses the incorrect domain to pay a power cost. 702.9.a. Errors of this sort are generally public, and all players are expected to be mindful of game state. 702.9.b. Remedies: 702.9.b.1. Perform a simple rewind if possible, to the moment before the card was played. 702.9.b.2. If a simple rewind is not possible, correct the cost paid if possible, by exhausting, or recycling runes as needed. 702.9.b.2.a. If runes were incorrectly recycled as part of the cost, rewind if possible. 702.9.b.3. If rewinding is not possible, instruct the players to continue playing. 702.10. Looking at Secret Information [Warning]: A player looks at information that is not available to any player. See CR 127. Privacy for information types. 702.10.a. Players should not be penalized via a remedy for errors their opponents make. Example: If one of your opponents inappropriately flips over the top card of their deck, you do not receive a penalty if you see it. 702.10.b. Remedies: 702.10.b.1. If possible, take involved cards in the nowknown secret information and rerandomize them with the original randomized source of appropriate cards to remove the information advantage. 702.10.b.2. If this is not possible, reveal the information to all players to remove the information advantage and instruct the players to continue playing. 702.11. Looking at Opponent Private Information [Warning]: A player accidentally looks at information that is private to their opponent. See CR 127. Privacy for information types. 702.11.a. Players should not be penalized via a remedy for errors their opponents make. Example: If one of your opponents inappropriately drops a card from their hand on the table, you do not receive a penalty if you see it. 702.11.b. Remedies: 702.11.b.1. The opponent whose private information it is may decide whether to take involved cards in the nowknown private information and rerandomize them with the original randomized source of appropriate cards. 702.11.b.2. If they decide not to, instruct the players to proceed. 702.12. Drawing Extra Cards [Warning]: A player draws more cards than they are entitled to under the Core Rules as the result of a limited action. 702.12.a. Drawing extra cards is also looking at extra cards, but only this error should be recorded. 702.12.b. Remedies: 702.12.b.1. If the error is caught before the extra cards drawn are added to a private set, shuffle them into the main deck appropriately to remove the information advantage. 702.12.b.2. If the error is caught after the cards drawn are added to a private set and it is within the round cycle, the next opponent in turn order of the erroring player looks at that player's hand and chooses the appropriate number of cards to shuffle into the main deck appropriately. 702.12.b.3. If at a later stage in the game it is determined a player has more cards in hand than they should, the remedy should be applied at this time. 702.13. Nonpublic Card Error [Warning]: A player interacts with a nonpublic card in a manner other than how they are entitled to under the Core Rules. 702.13.a. This includes hiding a card that does not have the Hidden keyword. 702.13.b. Upgrades to [Game Loss] if a player hides a card that doesn't have the Hidden keyword and doesn't correct it before it has an impact on an opponent's action. 702.14. Mulligan Procedure Error [Warning]: A player performs the mulligan procedure incorrectly. 702.14.a. Remedies: 702.14.a.1. If a player recycled and replaced more than 2 cards during their mulligan, the next opponent in turn order of the erroring player looks at that player's hand and may choose cards up to the number of extra cards mulliganed to have that player recycle and replace. 702.14.a.1.a. Example: If a player accidentally mulliganed 3 cards, the next opponent in turn order would look at that player's hand and may choose up to one card to have that player recycle and replace. 702.14.a.2. If this error is caught after gameplay has begun, instruct the players to proceed. 702.15. General Error [Warning]: Any other violation of the Rules of Riftbound. 702.15.a. This is a catchall for any other game play error. 702.15.b. Errors of this sort are generally public, and all players are expected to be mindful of game state. 702.15.c. Remedies: 702.15.c.1. Rewind if possible. 702.15.c.2. Otherwise, instruct the players to continue playing. 702.16. Failure to Maintain Game State [Warning]: A player does not call out another player's failure to maintain the proper game state, including missed scoring from hold and conquer. 702.16.a. Generally this error occurs when a player's opponent commits a game play error and the player doesn't call a judge immediately. 702.16.b. Unlike other Game Play Errors, this error is primarily for tracking and never upgrades unless specifically instructed by the head judge. 703. Tournament Errors 703.1. Overview 703.1.a. A tournament error is caused by actions in or around a tournament match that violate tournament procedure expectations. 703.1.b. If a player commits the same category of tournament error [Warning] 3 or more times in the same day of a competition, the penalty is upgraded to [Game Loss]. 703.1.c. At low OPL, penalties should generally be less harsh and rewinds may be applied even if the erroring player gains an information advantage. 703.1.c.1. Penalties that require an opponent of the erroring player to make a choice can be made at random or by a judge if they can't be avoided by a rewind. 703.2. Slow Play [Warning]: A player is performing their start of game procedure or is playing midgame at an unreasonably slow pace. 703.2.a. Players must take their turns in a timely manner, appropriate to a judge according to the state of the game at the time, and adhere to time limits specified for the tournament. 703.2.b. Players may ask a judge to watch their game for slow play. 703.2.c. Intentionally stalling to gain an advantage is cheating. See 704.8 for more information about cheating. 703.3. Decklist Error [Game Loss]: A player submits a decklist for registration that contains illegal elements. 703.3.a. Examples: 703.3.a.1. More or fewer cards than appropriate deck size. See 402 for more information about deck size. 703.3.a.2. Cards not legal in the format of the tournament. 703.3.a.3. More than 3 copies of a main deck card between main deck and sideboard. 703.3.a.4. Cards that do not match the domain of the registered legend. 703.3.a.5. A chosen champion that does not match the identity of the legend. 703.3.b. Remedies: 703.3.b.1. The player must correct their decklist to a legal state making as little change as possible and ensure that their deck matches the newly registered deck. 703.3.b.2. If the cards required to correct the decklist cannot be acquired in a timely manner, the head judge can issue a proxy. 703.4. Deck Presentation Error [Warning]: A player's deck's contents are illegal during presentation to an opponent or during gameplay. 703.4.a. Examples: 703.4.a.1. A player deck does not match their registered decklist. 703.4.a.2. A player submits a battlefield they have already used in the match. 703.4.a.3. A player forgets to restore their deck to a presideboard state for the first game of a match. 703.4.a.4. A player forgets to take their chosen champion from their main deck and place it in the chosen champion zone. 703.4.a.5. A player's deck is the incorrect deck size. See 402 for more information about deck size. (Example: A player misplaced a card or forgot to shuffle their banished cards back into their deck between games) 703.4.b. Remedies: 703.4.b.1. If the error is caught by any player before opening hands have been drawn, restore the deck to its correct state if possible and instruct players to proceed. 703.4.b.2. If the error is caught by the erroring player after opening hands have been drawn and it is easily possible, restore the deck to its correct state and instruct players to proceed. For example: 703.4.b.2.a. In game one of a match a player realizes they forgot to restore their deck to a presideboard state. 703.4.b.2.a.1. A judge can restore their deck to the appropriate state by returning cards to the main deck and sideboard as needed. 703.4.b.2.a.1.a. If sideboard cards are in the player's hand, they are replaced randomly by main deck cards that were incorrectly in the sideboard. 703.4.b.2.a.2. Shuffle the randomized portion of the main deck once this process is complete. 703.4.b.3. If the error is caught by a player other than the erroring player after opening hands have been drawn, the penalty is upgraded to [Game Loss]. 703.4.b.3.a. At casual or competitive OPL, if the error is a player forgetting to move their Chosen Champion from their Main Deck to the chosen champion zone at setup, the judge may downgrade the penalty to a [Warning] and restore the gamestate if possible, regardless of who caught the error or at which stage of the game it occurred. 703.4.b.3.b. Players may request a judge check an opponent's deck for legality. (Example: A player believes an opponent has a sideboard card in the first game.) 703.4.b.4. If restoring the deck to its correct state is not easily possible, the penalty is upgraded to [Game Loss]. 703.4.b.4.a. When applying a remedy for a missing Chosen Champion is applicable, if it occurs at any point after opening hands have been drawn and no copies of the Chosen Champion are available in the Main Deck to move to the Chosen Champion zone to restore the gamestate, the penalty may be downgraded to a [Warning] and gameplay can continue without the erroring player having a champion in the Chosen Champion zone. 703.4.b.5. If the cards required to correct the deck cannot be acquired in a timely manner, the head judge can issue a proxy. 703.5. Communication Violation [Warning]: A player does not effectively communicate with their opponents during gameplay. 703.5.a. This error includes any unintentional violation of the communication policies listed in section 500. 703.5.b. Remedies: 703.5.b.1. If any incorrect information was communicated, the correct information is supplied. 703.5.b.2. If any decisions were made based on incorrect communication, perform a rewind if possible. 703.6. Marked Cards [Warning]: A player's cards are possible to identify without seeing their face. 703.6.a. This includes but is not limited to scratches, discoloration, and bends. 703.6.b. If a player's cards are sleeved, the cards must be examined while in the sleeves to determine if they are marked. 703.6.c. The Head Judge has the authority to determine if a card in a player's deck is marked. 703.6.d. Remedies: 703.6.d.1. Judges may request that a player remove their current sleeves or replace any of the deck's current sleeves or cards immediately, or before the next round. 703.6.d.2. If the cards required to correct the deck cannot be acquired in a timely manner, the head judge can issue a proxy. 703.7. Insufficient Randomization [Warning]: A player did not sufficiently randomize their deck when required to. 703.7.a. If a player believes an opponent has not sufficiently randomized their Main Deck or Rune Deck before presenting them, they may call a judge. 703.7.b. Pile shuffling is not a sufficient randomization method and should only be used as a counting method. 703.7.c. Remedies: 703.7.c.1. A judge may instruct a player to rerandomize their deck. 703.7.c.2. A judge may randomize the player's deck for them. 703.8. Late to Match: A player arrives at their assigned match after the round clock has started. 703.8.a. If the player arrives within 2 minutes of the round start, the penalty is a [Warning] and a time extension is issued. 703.8.b. If the player arrives within 10 minutes of the round start, the penalty is a [Warning] and a time extension is issued. At high OPL the penalty is upgraded to [Game Loss]. 703.8.c. If the player arrives after 10 minutes of the round start, the penalty is a [Match Loss]. 703.8.d. If a player never arrives for their match, the penalty is a [Match Loss] and the player is dropped from the tournament unless they report to a judge before the next match begins. 703.8.e. Players may call a judge before the round clock starts or in between games of a match to request up to a 10 minute time extension in lieu of penalty at the judge's discretion. (Example: A player requests to use the restroom.) 703.9. Outside Assistance: A player receives advice or strategic assistance from an individual outside of the match. 703.9.a. If the player receiving the advice actively refuses the advice by calling a judge, they receive a [Warning]. Otherwise, that player receives a [Match Loss]. This penalty does not apply if the head judge deems the advice was delivered maliciously. 703.9.b. If the player receiving the advice solicited the advice, it is cheating. See 704.8 for more information about cheating. 703.9.c. Spectators providing advice may be barred from the tournament venue if the advice was given maliciously or knowingly. 703.9.d. It is not outside assistance to receive strategic advice from a teammate in the 2v2 format or in other team formats when specified. 703.9.e. At a judge's discretion, a player may receive assistance with the physical logistics of the competition, including game actions such as shuffling or card movement. This is not considered outside assistance. 703.10. Improperly Determining a Winner [Match Loss]: Games and matches of Riftbound must be decided by playing Riftbound appropriate to the tournament format. 703.10.a. Other methods, including but not limited to flipping a coin, rolling dice, or playing other games, may not be used to determine a winner. 703.10.b. Playing other formats of Riftbound other than the one designated for the tournament with the appropriate registered decklist may not be used to determine a winner. 703.10.c.
